Experiment EXP09-25-07-21-KtTayU:
		def similarityConnectThresholds = [0.9]
		def agentNumbers = [50,100,200,400,800]//, 1000, 2000, 5000] // number of agents in the network
		def chainLengths = [5,10,20] // the length of the chain to drop into the network (cannot be less than 3!)
		def randomWorksNumberMultipliers = [1,2] // number of random works (outside chain) to drop into the network;
		def maxDistances = [5,10,30] // the maximum number of hops when doing decentralized similarity search;
		def similaritySearchThresholds = [1] // consider only items that are this similar when searching for path;
		def graphTypes = ['random','smallWorld']

Repeating after crash trying to avoid reruning what was already run:
		def similarityConnectThresholds = [0.9]
		def agentNumbers = [400]//, 1000, 2000, 5000] // number of agents in the network
		def chainLengths = [5] // the length of the chain to drop into the network (cannot be less than 3!)
		def randomWorksNumberMultipliers = [2] // number of random works (outside chain) to drop into the network;
		def maxDistances = [5,10,30] // the maximum number of hops when doing decentralized similarity search;
		def similaritySearchThresholds = [1] // consider only items that are this similar when searching for path;
		def graphTypes = ['random','smallWorld']

After this -- rerun all the rest
