	abstract = {We argue that a critical difference distinguishing machines from organisms and computers from brains is not complexity in a structural sense, but a difference in dynamical organization that is not well accounted for by current complexity measures. We propose a measure of the complexity of a system that is largely orthogonal to computational, information theoretic, or thermodynamic conceptions of structural complexity. What we call a system’s dynamical depth is a separate dimension of system complexity that measures the degree to which it exhibits discrete levels of nonlinear dynamical organization in which successive levels are distinguished by local entropy reduction and constraint generation. A system with greater dynamical depth than another consists of a greater number of such nested dynamical levels. Thus, a mechanical or linear thermodynamic system has less dynamical depth than an inorganic self-organized system, which has less dynamical depth than a living system. Including an assessment of dynamical depth can provide a more precise and systematic account of the fundamental difference between inorganic systems (low dynamical depth) and living systems (high dynamical depth), irrespective of the number of their parts and the causal relations between them.},

	abstract = {It is well known that for many NP-complete problems, such as K-Sat, etc., typical cases are easy to solve; so that computationally hard cases must be rare (assuming P = NP). This paper shows that NP-complete problems can be summarized by at least one "order parameter", and that the hard problems occur at a critical value of such a parameter. This critical value separates two regions of characteristically different properties. For example, for K-colorability, the critical value separates overconstrained from underconstrained random graphs, and it marks the value at which the probability of a solution changes abruptly from near 0 to near 1. It is the high density of well-separated almost solutions (local minima) at this boundary that cause search algorithms to "thrash". This boundary is a type of phase transition and we show that it is preserved under mappings between problems. We show that for some P problems either there is no phase transition or it occurs for bounded N (and so bounds the cost). These results suggest a way of deciding if a problem is in P or NP and why they are different.},

Theoretical and experimental studies show that critical systems often exhibit optimal computational properties, suggesting the possibility that criticality has been evolutionarily selected as a useful trait for our nervous system. Evidence for criticality has been found in cell cultures, brain slices, and anesthetized animals. Yet, inconsistent results were reported for recordings in awake animals and humans, and current results point to open questions about the exact nature and mechanism of criticality, as well as its functional role. Therefore, the criticality hypothesis has remained a controversial proposition. Here, we provide an account of the mathematical and physical foundations of criticality. In the light of this conceptual framework, we then review and discuss recent experimental studies with the aim of identifying important next steps to be taken and connections to other fields that should be explored.},

First of all, we provide an analytical characterization of such an approach, by means of formulating combinatorial optimization problems into autonomous multi-entity systems and thereafter examining the microscopic characteristics of optimal solutions with respect to discrete state variables and local fitness functions. Next, we analyze the complexity of searching in the solution space based on the representation of fitness network and the observation of phase transition. In the second part of the paper, following the analytical characterization, we describe a decentralized, self-organized algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The validation results obtained by testing on a set of benchmark TSP instances have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The link established between the microscopic characterization of hard computational systems and the design of self-organized computing methods provides a new way of studying and tackling hard combinatorial optimization problems.},

Planning can be done directly by introducing a generative model for plans and optimizing an objective function calculated via plan simulation. Plan recovery is achieved almost without modifying optimization queries. These queries are simply executed in parallel with plan execution by a robot meaning that they continuously optimize dynamically varying objective functions tracking their optima. Experiments with the NAO robot showed that replanning can be naturally done within this approach without developing special plan recovery methods.},

Hence, how to solve this problem hinges on how to properly handle semantic relevance in cognitive modeling, which is an area of cognitive science that deals with simulating human's cognitive processes in a computerized model. By "semantic relevance", we mean certain inferential relations among acquired beliefs which may facilitate information retrieval and practical reasoning under certain epistemic constraints, e. g., the insufficiency of knowledge, the limitation of time budget, etc. However, traditional approaches to relevance—as for example, relevance logic, the Bayesian approach, as well as Description Logic—have failed to do justice to the foregoing constraints, and in this sense, they are not proper tools for solving the frame problem/relevance problem. As we will argue in this paper, Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) can handle the frame problem in a more proper manner, because the resulting solution seriously takes epistemic constraints on cognition as a fundamental theoretical principle.},

In Probably Approximately Correct, computer scientist Leslie Valiant presents a theory of the theoryless. The key is “probably approximately correct” learning, Valiant’s model of how anything can act without needing to understand what is going on. The study of probably approximately correct algorithms reveals the shared computational nature of evolution and cognition, indicates how computers might possess authentic intelligence, and shows why hacking a problem can be far more effective than developing a theory to explain it. After all, finding a mate is a lot more satisfying than finding a theory of mating.Offering an elegant, powerful model that encompasses all of life’s complexity, Probably Approximately Correct will revolutionize the way we look at the universe’s greatest mysteries.},

We describe Nootropia in the context of adaptive, content-based document filtering and evaluate it using virtual users. The results demonstrate Nootropia’s ability to adapt to both short-term variations and more radical changes in the user’s interests, and to dynamically control its size and connectivity in the process. Advantages over existing approaches to profile adaptation, such as learning algorithms and evolutionary algorithms are also highlighted.},

Here we demonstrate for the first time that hierarchy evolves as a result of the costs of network connections. We confirm a previous finding that connection costs drive the evolution of modularity, and show that they also cause the evolution of hierarchy. We further confirm that hierarchy promotes evolvability in addition to evolvability caused by modularity. Because many biological and human-made phenomena can be represented as networks, and because hierarchy is a critical network property, this finding is immediately relevant to a wide array of fields, from biology, sociology, and medical research to harnessing evolution for engineering.},

	abstract = {The definitive pioneering blueprint covering the what, why and how of the blockchain.  Blockchains are new technology layers that rewire the Internet and threaten to side-step older legacy constructs and centrally served businesses. At its core, a blockchain injects trust into the network, cutting off some intermediaries from serving that function and creatively disrupting how they operate. Metaphorically, blockchains are the ultimate non-stop computers. Once launched, they never go down, and offer an incredible amount of resiliency, making them dependable and attractive for running a new generation of decentralized services and software applications.  The Business Blockchain charts new territory in advancing our understanding of the blockchain by unpacking its elements like no other before. William Mougayar anticipates a future that consists of thousands, if not millions of blockchains that will enable not only frictionless value exchange, but also a new flow of value, redefining roles, relationships, power and governance. In this book, Mougayar makes two other strategic assertions. First, the blockchain has polymorphic characteristics; its application will result in a multiplicity of effects. Second, we shouldn’t ask ourselves what problems the blockchain solves, because that gives us a narrow view on its potential. Rather, we should imagine new opportunities, and tackle even more ambitious problems that cross organizational, regulatory and mental boundaries.  Drawing on 34 years of technology industry experience as an executive, analyst, consultant, entrepreneur, startup mentor, author, blogger, educator, thought leader and investor, William Mougayar describes a future that is influenced by fundamental shifts brought by blockchain technology as the catalyst for change. William Mougayar has been described as the most sophisticated blockchain business thinker. He is a blockchain industry insider whose work has already shaped and influenced the understanding of blockchain for people around the world, via his generous blogging and rigorous research insights. He is a direct participant in the crypto-technology market, working alongside startups, entrepreneurs, pioneers, leaders, innovators, creators, enterprise executives and practitioners; in addition to being an investor, advisor, and board member in some of the leading organizations in this space, such as the Ethereum Foundation, OpenBazaar and Coin Center. Just as the Internet created new possibilities that we didn’t foresee in its early years, the blockchain will give rise to new business models and ideas that may still be invisible. Following an engaging Foreword by Vitalik Buterin, this book is organized along these 7 chapters: 1. What is the Blockchain? 2. How Blockchain Trust Infiltrates 3. Obstacles, Challenges \& Mental Blocks 4. Blockchain in Financial Services 5. Lighthouse Industries \& New Intermediaries 6. Implementing Blockchain Technology 7. Decentralization as the Way Forward The Business Blockchain is an invitation for technologists to better understand the business potential of the blockchain, and for business minded people to grasp the many facets of blockchain technology. This book teaches you how to think about the blockchain.},

More and more, these algorithms work by learning from the trails of data we leave in our newly digital world. Like curious children, they observe us, imitate, and experiment. And in the world’s top research labs and universities, the race is on to invent the ultimate learning algorithm: one capable of discovering any knowledge from data, and doing anything we want, before we even ask.Machine learning is the automation of discovery—the scientific method on steroids—that enables intelligent robots and computers to program themselves. No field of science today is more important yet more shrouded in mystery. Pedro Domingos, one of the field’s leading lights, lifts the veil for the first time to give us a peek inside the learning machines that power Google, Amazon, and your smartphone. He charts a course through machine learning’s five major schools of thought, showing how they turn ideas from neuroscience, evolution, psychology, physics, and statistics into algorithms ready to serve you. Step by step, he assembles a blueprint for the future universal learner—the Master Algorithm—and discusses what it means for you, and for the future of business, science, and society.If data-ism is today’s rising philosophy, this book will be its bible. The quest for universal learning is one of the most significant, fascinating, and revolutionary intellectual developments of all time. A groundbreaking book, The Master Algorithm is the essential guide for anyone and everyone wanting to understand not just how the revolution will happen, but how to be at its forefront.},

Concluding with a discussion of how a neurally realized system of symbol-manipulation could have evolved and how such a system could unfold developmentally within the womb, Marcus helps to set the future agenda of cognitive neuroscience.},

Par delà le champ d'une investigation épistémologique, qui tient compte des thèses de la thermodynamique, de la fabrication des objets techniques, de la formation des cristaux, l'originalité de Gilbert Simondon est de questionner en son fond historique et philosophique l'idée même de principe d'individuation. Attitude méthodologique qui conduit à concevoir sous un jour radicalement neuf les rapports d'empiétements et de chevauchements de l'individu à l'égard du champ transindividuel dont il émane et qui lui demeure toujours coprésent dans ses mutations et ses métamorphoses. Ni objet ni sujet purs, chaque individu, sous son apparente identité, se révèle dès lors théâtre d'individuations, où s'entrecroisent les tensions résolutrices d'un champ préindividuel formant monde. Situation qui conduit Gilbert Simondon à développer une conception renouvelée de l'information qui, par delà l'idéalisme et le réalisme emprunté aux techniques du message codé, se révèle dans sa conception de la transduction, structure d'être et acte de connaissance en voie de résolution. L'originalité de cette ø euvre est d'allier à une rigoureuse réflexion d'ordre épistémologique et technique ancrée dans notre contemporanéité, une méditation historique de la tradition qui ne craint pas de remettre en question des attitudes philosophiques qui semblaient et semblent toujours aller de soi. Il s'agit en fait de réformer nos principes et nos concepts opératoires pour aborder, sous un jour neuf, le problème crucial de l'individu. Nouvelle édition, rassemblant L'individu et sa genèse physico-biologique, paru en 1964, aux P.U.F., et L'individuation psychique et collective, paru chez Aubier en 1989, qui formaient ensemble la thèse de doctorat de Gilbert Simondon, L'Individuation à la lumière des notions de Forme et d'Information, ainsi que Histoire de la Notion d'Individu, inédit.},

It demands a radical shift in standpoint, an almost paradoxical posture in which living systems are described in terms of what lies outside the domain of descriptions. Professor Humberto Maturana, with his colleague Francisco Varela, have undertaken the construction of a systematic theoretical biology which attempts to define living systems not as they are objects of observation and description, nor even as in teracting systems, but as self-contained unities whose only reference is to them selves. Thus, the standpoint of description of such unities from the 'outside', i. e. , by an observer, already seems to violate the fundamental requirement which Maturana and Varela posit for the characterization of such system- namely, that they are autonomous, self-referring and self-constructing closed systems - in short, autopoietic systems in their terms. Yet, on the basis of such a conceptual method, and such a theory of living systems, Maturana goes on to define cognition as a biological phenomenon; as, in effect, the very nature of all living systems. And on this basis, to generate the very domains of interac tion among such systems which constitute language, description and thinking.},

	shorttitle = {Neural {Darwinism}},
	abstract = {Already the subject of considerable pre-publication discussion, this magisterial work by one of the nation’s leading neuroscientists presents a radically new view of the function of the brain and nervous system. Its central idea is that the nervous system in each individual operates as a selective system resembling natural selection in evolution, but operating by different mechanisms. By providing a fundamental neural basis for categorization of the things of this world it unifies perception, action, and learning. The theory also completely revises our view of memory, which it considers to be a dynamic process of recategorization rather than a replicative store of attributes. This has deep implications for the interpretation of various psychological states from attention to dreaming.Neural Darwinism ranges over many disciplines, focusing on key problems in developmental and evolutionary biology, anatomy, physiology, ethology, and psychology. This book should therefore prove indispensable to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in these fields, to students of medicine, and to those in the social sciences concerned with the relation of behavior to biology. Beyond that, this far-ranging theory of brain function is bound to stimulate renewed discussions of such philosophical issues as the mind-body problem, the origins of knowledge, and the perceptual basis of language.},

	abstract = {Data processing complexity, partitionability, locality and provenance play a crucial role in the effectiveness of distributed data processing. Dynamics in data processing necessitates effective modeling which allows the understanding and reasoning of the fluidity of data processing. Through virtualization, resources have become scattered, heterogeneous, and dynamic in performance and networking. In this paper, we propose a new distributed data processing model based on automata where data processing is modeled as state transformations. This approach falls within a category of declarative concurrent paradigms which are fundamentally different than imperative approaches in that communication and function order are not explicitly modeled. This allows an abstraction of concurrency and thus suited for distributed systems. Automata gives us a way to formally describe data processing independent from underlying processes while also providing routing information to route data based on its current state in a P2P fashion around networks of distributed processing nodes. Through an implementation, named Pumpkin, of the model we capture the automata schema and routing table into a data processing protocol and show how globally distributed resources can be brought together in a collaborative way to form a processing plane where data objects are self-routable on the plane.},

The first five chapters of the thesis have remained almost completely unchanged but the other chapters have undergone considerable revision and expansion. Most importantly, I have replaced the formal argument-based system of the old Chapters 6, 7 and 8 with a revised and extended system, whieh I have developed during the last three years in collaboration with Giovanni Sartor. Apart from some technical improvements, the main additions to the old system are the enriehment of its language with a nonprovability operator, and the ability to formalise reasoning about preference criteria. Moreover, the new system has a very intuitive dialectieal form, as opposed to the rather unintuitive fixed-point appearance of the old system. Another important revision is the split of the old Chapter 9 into two new chapters. The old Section 9. 1 on related research has been updated and expanded into a whole chapter, while the rest of the old chapter is now in revised form in Chapter 10. This chapter also contains two new contributions, a detailed discussion of Gordon's Pleadings Game, and a general description of a multi-Iayered overall view on the structure of argu mentation, comprising a logieal, dialectical, procedural and strategie layer. Finally, in the revised conclusion I have paid more attention to the relevance of my investigations for legal philosophy and argumentation theory.},

The simplest nontrivial time-symmetric law that can be used to model a dynamically closed universe is the Newtonian N-body problem with vanishing total energy and angular momentum. Because of special properties of this system (likely to be shared by any law of the Universe), its typical solutions all divide at a uniquely defined point into two halves. In each, a well-defined measure of shape complexity fluctuates but grows irreversibly between rising bounds from that point. Structures that store dynamical information are created as the complexity grows and act as “records.” Each solution can be viewed as having a single past and two distinct futures emerging from it. Any internal observer must be in one half of the solution and will only be aware of the records of one branch and deduce a unique past and future direction from inspection of the available records.},

	abstract = {Today s mobile robot perception is insufficient for acting goal-directedly in unconstrained, dynamic everyday environments like a home, a factory, or a city. Subject to restrictions in bandwidth, computer power, and computation time, a robot has to react to a wealth of dynamically changing stimuli in such environments, requiring rapid, selective attention to decisive, action-relevant information of high current utility. Robust and general engineering methods for effectively and efficiently coupling perception, action and reasoning are unavailable. Interesting performance, if any, is currently only achieved by sophisticated robot programming exploiting domain features and specialties, which leaves ordinary users no chance of changing how the robot acts. The purpose of this volume - outcome of a GI-Dagstuhl Seminar held in Dagstuhl Castle in June 2006 - is to give a first overview on the concept of affordances for the design and implementation of autonomous mobile robots acting goal-directedly in a dynamic environment. The aim is to develop affordance-based control as a method for robotics. The potential of this new methodology will be shown by going beyond navigation-like tasks towards goaldirected autonomous manipulation in the project demonstrators.},

Engagingly written, and balancing technical detail with intuitive explanations, Complex Adaptive Systems focuses on the key tools and ideas that have emerged in the field since the mid-1990s, as well as the techniques needed to investigate such systems. It provides a detailed introduction to concepts such as emergence, self-organized criticality, automata, networks, diversity, adaptation, and feedback. It also demonstrates how complex adaptive systems can be explored using methods ranging from mathematics to computational models of adaptive agents.  John Miller and Scott Page show how to combine ideas from economics, political science, biology, physics, and computer science to illuminate topics in organization, adaptation, decentralization, and robustness. They also demonstrate how the usual extremes used in modeling can be fruitfully transcended.},

	shorttitle = {Reassembling the {Social}},
	abstract = {Reassembling the Social is a fundamental challenge from one of the world's leading social theorists to how we understand society and the 'social'. Bruno Latour's contention is that the word 'social', as used by Social Scientists, has become laden with assumptions to the point where it has become misnomer. When the adjective is applied to a phenomenon, it is used to indicate a stablilized state of affairs, a bundle of ties that in due course may be used to account for another phenomenon. But Latour also finds the word used as if it described a type of material, in a comparable way to an adjective such as 'wooden' or 'steely'. Rather than simply indicating what is already assembled together, it is now used in a way that makes assumptions about the nature of what is assembled. It has become a word that designates two distinct things: a process of assembling; and a type of material, distinct from others. Latour shows why 'the social' cannot be thought of as a kind of material or domain, and disputes attempts to provide a 'social explanations' of other states of affairs. While these attempts have been productive (and probably necessary) in the past, the very success of the social sciences mean that they are largely no longer so. At the present stage it is no longer possible to inspect the precise constituents entering the social domain. Latour returns to the original meaning of 'the social' to redefine the notion, and allow it to trace connections again. It will then be possible to resume the traditional goal of the social sciences, but using more refined tools. Drawing on his extensive work examining the 'assemblages' of nature, Latour finds it necessary to scrutinize thoroughly the exact content of what is assembled under the umbrella of Society. This approach, a 'sociology of associations', has become known as Actor-Network-Theory, and this book is an essential introduction both for those seeking to understand Actor-Network Theory, or the ideas of one of its most influential proponents.},

	abstract = {The formal structure of evolutionary theory is based upon the dynamics of alleles, individuals and populations. As such, the theory must assume the prior existence of these entities. This existence problem was recognized nearly a century ago, when DeVries (1904,Species and Varieties: Their Origin by Mutation) stated. “Natural selection may explain the survival of the fittest, but it cannot explain the arrival of the fittest.” At the heart of the existence problem is determining how biological organizations arise in ontogeny and in phylogeny. We develop a minimal theory of biological organization based on two abstractions from chemistry. The theory is formulated using λ-calculus, which provides a natural framework capturing (i) the constructive feature of chemistry, that the collision of molecules generates specific new molecules, and (ii) chemistry's diversity of equivalence classes, that many different reactants can yield the same stable product. We employ a well-stirred and constrained stochastic flow reactor to explore the generic behavior of large numbers of applicatively interacting λ-expressions. This constructive dynamical system generates fixed systems of transformation characterized by syntactical and functional invariances. Organizations are recognized and defined by these syntactical and functional regularities. Objects retained within an organization realize and algebraic structure and possess a grammar which is invariant under the interaction between objects. An organization is self-maintaining, and is characterized by (i) boundaries established by the invariances, (ii) strong self-repair capabilities responsible for a robustness to perturbation, and (iii) a center, defined as the smallest kinetically persistent and self-maintaining generator set of the algebra. Imposition of different boundary conditions on the stochastic flow reactor generates different levels of organization, and a diversity of organizations within each level. Level 0 is defined by selfcopying objects or simple ensembles of copying objects. Level 1 denotes a new object class, whose objects are self-maintaining organizations made of Level 0 objects, and Level 2 is defined by self-maintaining metaorganizations composed of Level 1 organizations. These results invite analogy to the history of life, that is, to the progression from self-replication to self-maintaining procaryotic organizations to ultimately yield self-maintaining eucaryotic organizations. In our system self-maintaining organizations arise as a generic consequence of two features of chemistry, without appeal to natural selection. We hold these findings as calling for increased attention to the structural basis of biological order.},

It is fast as well --- task-switching is 1000x faster than Java threads and 60x faster than other lightweight tasking frameworks, and message-passing is 3x faster than Erlang (currently the gold standard for {\textless}em{\textgreater}concurrency-oriented{\textless}/em{\textgreater}programming).},

Both are achieved by implementing a wait-free, atomic, single-writer multi-reader register in unreliable, asynchronous networks. The two message-passing models considered are a complete network with processor failures and an arbitrary network with dynamic link failures.These results make it possible to view the shared-memory model as a higher-level language for designing algorithms in asynchronous distributed systems. Any wait-free algorithm based on atomic, single-writer multi-reader registers can be automatically emulated in message-passing systems, provided that at least a majority of the processors are not faulty and remain connected. The overhead introduced by these emulations is polynomial in the number of processors in the system.Immediate new results are obtained by applying the emulators to known shared-memory algorithms. These include, among others, protocols to solve the following problems in the message-passing model in the presence of processor or link failures: multi-writer multi-reader registers, concurrent time-stamp systems, l-exclusion, atomic snapshots, randomized consensus, and implementation of data structures.},

Unlike most candidate explanations, this paper proposes that increasing evolvability can result without any pressure to adapt. The insight is that if evolvability is heritable, then an unbiased drifting process across genotypes can still create a distribution of phenotypes biased towards evolvability, because evolvable organisms diffuse more quickly through the space of possible phenotypes. Furthermore, because phenotypic divergence often correlates with founding niches, niche founders may on average be more evolvable, which through population growth provides a genotypic bias towards evolvability. Interestingly, the combination of these two mechanisms can lead to increasing evolvability without any pressure to out-compete other organisms, as demonstrated through experiments with a series of simulated models. Thus rather than from pressure to adapt, evolvability may inevitably result from any drift through genotypic space combined with evolution's passive tendency to accumulate niches.},

A couple of approaches are already using the chemical metaphor, such as, Gamma, MGS, amorphous computing, membrane computing, and reaction-diffusion processors. However, in accordance with Conrad's tradeoff principle, programming a chemical computer appears to be difficult. Therefore, in order to further exploit the mentioned properties new programming techniques are required. Here we describe how chemical organization theory can serve as a tool for chemical programming. The theory allows to predict the potential behavior of a chemical program and thus supports a programmer in the design of a chemical-like control system. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to the maximal independent set problem. We show that the desired solutions are predicted by the theory as chemical organizations. Furthermore the theory uncovers "undesirable" organizations, representing uncompleted halting computations due to insufficient amount of molecules.

Solomonoff’s theory of universal induction formally solves the problem of sequence prediction for unknown prior distribution. We combine both ideas and get a parameter-free theory of universal Artificial Intelligence. We give strong arguments that the resulting AIXI model is the most intelligent unbiased agent possible. We outline how the AIXI model can formally solve a number of problem classes, including sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. The major drawback of the AIXI model is that it is un-computable. To overcome this problem, we construct a modified algorithm AIXItl that is still effectively more intelligent than any other time t and length l bounded agent. The computation time of AIXItl is of the order t·2l. The discussion includes formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations of the AIXI theory to other AI approaches.},

	abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

A concept of sign processes that is flexible enough to perform two functions as follows is everything that is required for this framework. It must relate to the most various manifestations of sign processes, thus enabling a variety of scientific disciplines to use a common concept where it seems appropriate; at the same time, it must be precise enough to fit the unique requirements of any individual branch of science dealing with a concrete manifestation. Different types of sign processes have to be related to, if not derived from (albeit in a nonformal way), different types of self-organisation.

Section one discusses the hard and the soft science approaches to information. It will be argued that a UTI approach needs to overcome the divide between these approaches and can do so by adopting an historical and logical account of information. Section two gives a system theoretical sketch of such an information concept. It is based upon assuming a co-extension of self-organisation and information. Information is defined as a tripartite relation such that (1) Bateson’s “making a difference” is the build-up of the self-organised order; (2) Bateson’s “difference” that makes the difference is the perturbation that triggers the build-up; (3) Bateson’s difference that is made is made to the system because the perturbation serves a function for the system’s self-organisation. In semiotic terms, (1) a sign (= the self-organised order) relates (2) a signified (= the perturbation) (3) to a signmaker (= the system). In a third section, consequences of this concept for the knowledge about techno-social information processes and information structures will be focused on.},

It produces a new level of evolution, with a much higher capacity for adaptation. The most important levels are discussed, with an emphasis on the level characterizing man as distinct from the animals. An analysis of the shortcomings of this "rational" system of cognition leads to a first sketch of how the next higher "meta-rational" level would look like.},

In the model presented, transition probabilities between three population types are used to emulate stability: stable types have low probabilities of making transitions to other types, and unstable types have high transition probabilities. The model itself consists of two stable types and one unstable type, and conditions are explored that lead to dominance by the unstable type. Under certain conditions the unstable type can defeat a stable type, even in an environment that always favors the stable type.},

Identifying the wants, needs, and knowledge of internet users can be like listening to a mob. In the Web 2.0 era, leveraging the collective power of user contributions, interactions, and feedback is the key to market dominance. A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles-the collective intelligence--locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users. Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches. This book is for Java developers implementing Collective Intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit. Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.},

In recent years, philosophers and theorists of a variety of ontological and epistemological backgrounds have begun to employ the Baldwin effect in their accounts of the evolutionary emergence of mind and of how mind, through behavior, might affect evolution.The essays in this book discuss the originally proposed Baldwin effect, how it was modified over time, and its possible contribution to contemporary empirical and theoretical evolutionary studies. The topics include the effect of the modern evolutionary synthesis on the notion of the Baldwin effect, the nature and role of niche construction in contemporary evolutionary theory, the Baldwin effect in the context of developmental systems theory, the possible role of the Baldwin effect in computational cognitive science biosemiotics, and the emergence of consciousness and language.},

These spatiotemporal patterns, called resting state networks, display low-frequency characteristics ({\textless}0.1 Hz) observed typically in the BOLD-fMRI signal of human subjects. We aim here to understand the origins of resting state activity through modeling via a global spiking attractor network of the brain. This approach offers a realistic mechanistic model at the level of each single brain area based on spiking neurons and realistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. Integrating the biologically realistic diffusion tensor imaging/diffusion spectrum imaging-based neuroanatomical connectivity into the brain model, the resultant emerging resting state functional connectivity of the brain network fits quantitatively best the experimentally observed functional connectivity in humans when the brain network operates at the edge of instability. Under these conditions, the slow fluctuating ({\textless}0.1 Hz) resting state networks emerge as structured noise fluctuations around a stable low firing activity equilibrium state in the presence of latent “ghost” multistable attractors. The multistable attractor landscape defines a functionally meaningful dynamic repertoire of the brain network that is inherently present in the neuroanatomical connectivity.},

However, most of the brain’s energy consumption is devoted to ongoing metabolic activity not clearly associated with any particular stimulus or behaviour. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans aimed at understanding this ongoing activity have shown that spontaneous fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal occur continuously in the resting state. In humans, these fluctuations are temporally coherent within widely distributed cortical systems that recapitulate the functional architecture of responses evoked by experimentally administered tasks. Here, we show that the same phenomenon is present in anaesthetized monkeys even at anaesthetic levels known to induce profound loss of consciousness. We specifically demonstrate coherent spontaneous fluctuations within three well known systems (oculomotor, somatomotor and visual) and the ‘default’ system, a set of brain regions thought by some to support uniquely human capabilities. Our results indicate that coherent system fluctuations probably reflect an evolutionarily conserved aspect of brain functional organization that transcends levels of consciousness.},

In this study, we investigate the extent to which this task-related dichotomy is represented intrinsically in the resting human brain through examination of spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent signal. We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function. We suggest that both task-driven neuronal responses and behavior are reflections of this dynamic, ongoing, functional organization of the brain.},

To answer the surge for graph data management, many graph database solutions were developed. These databases are commonly classified as NoSQL graph databases, and they provide better support for graph data management than their relational counterparts. However, each of these databases implement their own operational graph data model, which differ among the products. Further, there is no commonly agreed conceptual model for graph databases. In this paper, we introduce a novel conceptual model for graph databases. The aim of our model is to provide analysts with a set of simple, well-defined, and adaptable conceptual components to perform rich analysis tasks. These components take into account the evolving aspect of the graph. Our model is analytics-oriented, flexible and incremental, enabling analysis over evolving graph data. The proposed model provides a typing mechanism for the underlying graph, and formally defines the minimal set of data structures and operators needed to analyze the graph.},

Proposed causes such as shortages of grain due to adverse weather, increasing meat consumption in China and India, conversion of corn to ethanol in the US, and investor speculation on commodity markets lead to widely diring implications for policy. A lack of clarity about which factors are responsible reinforces policy inaction. Here, for the first time, we construct a dynamic model that quantitatively agrees with food prices. The results show that the dominant causes of price increases are investor speculation and ethanol conversion. Models that just treat supply and demand are not consistent with the actual price dynamics. The two sharp peaks in 2007/2008 and 2010/2011 are specifically due to investor speculation, while an underlying trend is due to increasing demand from ethanol conversion. The model includes investor trend-following as well as shifting between commodities, equities and bonds to take advantage of increased expected returns. Claims that speculators cannot influence grain prices are shown to be invalid by direct analysis of price setting practices of granaries. Both causes of price increase, speculative investment and ethanol conversion, are promoted by recent regulatory changes - deregulation of the commodity markets, and policies promoting the conversion of corn to ethanol. Rapid action is needed to reduce the impacts of the price increases on global hunger.},

Despite the many possible contributing factors, the timing of violent protests in North Africa and the Middle East in 2011 as well as earlier riots in 2008 coincides with large peaks in global food prices. We identify a specific food price threshold above which protests become likely. These observations suggest that protests may reflect not only long-standing political failings of governments, but also the sudden desperate straits of vulnerable populations. If food prices remain high, there is likely to be persistent and increasing global social disruption. Underlying the food price peaks we also find an ongoing trend of increasing prices. We extrapolate these trends and identify a crossing point to the domain of high impacts, even without price peaks, in 2012-2013. This implies that avoiding global food crises and associated social unrest requires rapid and concerted action.},

In the Origin of Species (1859) Darwin challenged many of the most deeply held beliefs of the Western world. His insistence on the immense length of the past and on the abundance of life-forms, present and extinct, dislodged man from his central position in creation and called into question the role of the Creator. He showed that new species are achieved by natural selection, and that absence of plan is an inherent part of the evolutionary process. Darwin's prodigious reading, experimentation, and observations on his travels fed into his great work, which draws on material from the Galapagos Islands to rural Staffordshire, from English back gardens to colonial encounters. The present edition provides a detailed and accessible discussion of his theories and adds an account of the immediate responses to the book on publication.

	abstract = {The field of cognitive modeling has progressed beyond modeling cognition in the context of simple laboratory tasks and begun to attack the problem of modeling it in more complex, realistic environments, such as those studied by researchers in the field of human factors. The problems that the cognitive modeling community is tackling focus on modeling certain problems of communication and control that arise when integrating with the external environment factors such as implicit and explicit knowledge, emotion, cognition, and the cognitive system. These problems must be solved in order to produce integrated cognitive models of moderately complex tasks. Architectures of cognition in these tasks focus on the control of a central system, which includes control of the central processor itself, initiation of functional processes, such as visual search and memory retrieval, and harvesting the results of these functional processes. Because the control of the central system is conceptually different from the internal control required by individual functional processes, a complete architecture of cognition must incorporate two types of theories of control: Type 1 theories of the structure, functionality, and operation of the controller, and type 2 theories of the internal control of functional processes, including how and what they communicate to the controller. This book presents the current state of the art for both types of theories, as well as contrasts among current approaches to human-performance models. It will be an important resource for professional and student researchers in cognitive science, cognitive-engineering, and human-factors. Contributors: Kevin A. Gluck, Jerry T. Ball, Michael A.

For this reason, research efforts have focused on the mechanisms underlying the development of extinction-induced inhibition within fear circuits. However, recent studies in rodents have uncovered mechanisms that stabilize and destabilize fear memories, opening the possibility that extinction might be used to erase fear memories. This symposium focuses on several of these new developments, which involve the timing of extinction training. Extinction-induced erasure of fear occurs in very young rats, but is lost with the development of perineuronal nets in the amygdala that render fear memories impervious to extinction. Moreover, extinction administered during the reconsolidation phase, when fear memory is destabilized, updates the fear association as safe, thereby preventing the return of fear, in both rats and humans. The use of modified extinction protocols to eliminate fear memories complements existing pharmacological strategies for strengthening extinction.},

	abstract = {In this book, after discussing the fundamental problems of current science and other philosophic concepts, beginning with controversies between Heraclitus and Parmenides, Ilya Prigogine launches into a message of great hope: the future has not been determined. Contrary to globalisation and the apparent contemporary mass culture society, individual behaviour is beginning to increasingly become the key factor which governs the evolution of both the world and society as a whole. It is a message that challenges existing widespread views, implicitly or explicitly, through mass communication; moreover the importance of the individual's actions implies a reflection of each person on the responsibilities that each one assumes when taking or acting upon a decision. This responsibility is associated with the freedom of thought as well as a critical analysis of fashions, customs, preconceived ideas, and ideologies, externally imposed: exactly contrary to the ideas of those who wish us to be "perfect consumers" in a world dominated only by monetary wealth. Challenging this drive towards the elimination of freedom of thought in the individual is now imperative if we are to save man and his planet from catastrophe, which seems to be ever imminent and (unfortunately) irreversible. This last book of Ilya Prigogine provides a small, disputable, but nonetheless valuable contribution towards that end.},

Each chapter focuses on a particular formal approach to categorization, presented by the proponent(s) or advocate(s) of that approach, and the authors consider the relation of this approach to other models and the ultimate objectives in their research programmes. The volume evaluates progress that has been made in the field and potential future developments.

We therefore employ the simplicity principle from perceptual organization to propose a simplicity model of unconstrained spontaneous grouping. The simplicity model predicts that people would prefer the categories for a set of novel items that provide the simplest encoding of these items. Classification predictions are derived from the model without information either about the number of categories sought or information about the distributional properties of the objects to be classified. These features of the simplicity model distinguish it from other models in unsupervised categorization (where, for example, the number of categories sought is determined via a free parameter), and we discuss how these computational differences are related to differences in modeling objectives. The predictions of the simplicity model are validated in four experiments. We also discuss the significance of simplicity in cognitive modeling more generally.},

While research in recommender systems grew out of information retrieval and filtering, the topic has steadily advanced into a legitimate and challenging research area of its own. Recommender systems have traditionally been studied from a content-based filtering vs. collaborative design perspective. Recommendations, however, are not delivered within a vacuum, but rather cast within an informal community of users and social context. Therefore, ultimately all recommender systems make connections among people and thus should be surveyed from such a perspective. This viewpoint is under-emphasized in the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a connection-oriented perspective toward recommender systems research. We posit that recommendation has an inherently social element and is ultimately intended to connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling or indirectly through the discovery of relationships implicit in extant data. Thus, recommender systems are characterized by how they model users to bring people together: explicitly or implicitly. Finally, user modeling and the connection-centric viewpoint raise broadening and social issues—such as evaluation, targeting, and privacy and trust—which we also briefly address.},

	abstract = {The seemingly innocent observation that the activities of organisms bring about changes in environments is so obvious that it seems an unlikely focus for a new line of thinking about evolution. Yet niche construction--as this process of organism-driven environmental modification is known--has hidden complexities. By transforming biotic and abiotic sources of natural selection in external environments, niche construction generates feedback in evolution on a scale hitherto underestimated--and in a manner that transforms the evolutionary dynamic. It also plays a critical role in ecology, supporting ecosystem engineering and influencing the flow of energy and nutrients through ecosystems. Despite this, niche construction has been given short shrift in theoretical biology, in part because it cannot be fully understood within the framework of standard evolutionary theory.Wedding evolution and ecology, this book extends evolutionary theory by formally including niche construction and ecological inheritance as additional evolutionary processes. The authors support their historic move with empirical data, theoretical population genetics, and conceptual models. They also describe new research methods capable of testing the theory. They demonstrate how their theory can resolve long-standing problems in ecology, particularly by advancing the sorely needed synthesis of ecology and evolution, and how it offers an evolutionary basis for the human sciences.Already hailed as a pioneering work by some of the world's most influential biologists, this is a rare, potentially field-changing contribution to the biological sciences.},

It is something right beneath our feet-the Earth itself!Throughout most of evolution humans walked barefoot and slept on the ground, largely oblivious that the surface of the Earth contains limitless healing energy. Science has discovered this energy as free-flowing electrons constantly replenished by solar radiation and lightning. Few people know it, but the ground provides a subtle electric signal that maintains health and governs the intricate mechanisms that make our bodies work-just like plugging a lamp into a power socket makes it light up. Modern lifestyle, including the widespread use of insulative rubber or plastic-soled shoes, has disconnected us from this energy and, of course, we no longer sleep on the ground as we did in times past.Earthing introduces the planet's powerful, amazing, and overlooked natural healing energy and how people anywhere can readily connect to it. This eye-opening book describes how the physical disconnect with the Earth creates abnormal physiology and contributes to inflammation, pain, fatigue, stress, and poor sleep. By reconnecting to the Earth, symptoms are rapidly relieved and even eliminated and recovery from surgery, injury, and athletic overexertion is accelerated.This never-before-told story-filled with fascinating research and real-life testimonials- chronicles a discovery with the potential to create a global health revolution.},

The world is not simply available; it is achieved rather than given. As with a painting in a gallery, the world has no meaning—no presence to be experienced—apart from our able engagement with it. We must show up, too, and bring along what knowledge and skills we’ve cultivated. This means that education, skills acquisition, and technology can expand the world’s availability to us and transform our consciousness. Although deeply philosophical, Varieties of Presence is nurtured by collaboration with scientists and artists. Cognitive science, dance, and performance art as well as Kant and Wittgenstein inform this literary and personal work of scholarship intended no less for artists and art theorists, psychologists, cognitive scientists, and anthropologists than for philosophers. Noë rejects the traditional representational theory of mind and its companion internalism, dismissing outright the notion that conceptual knowledge is radically distinct from other forms of practical ability or know-how. For him, perceptual presence and thought presence are species of the same genus. Both are varieties of exploration through which we achieve contact with the world. Forceful reflections on the nature of understanding, as well as substantial examination of the perceptual experience of pictures and what they depict or model are included in this far-ranging discussion.},

It’s widely believed that consciousness itself, that Holy Grail of science and philosophy, will soon be given a neural explanation. And yet, after decades of research, only one proposition about how the brain makes us conscious—how it gives rise to sensation, feeling, and subjectivity—has emerged unchallenged: We don’t have a clue. In this inventive work, Noë suggests that rather than being something that happens inside us, consciousness is something we do. Debunking an outmoded philosophy that holds the scientific study of consciousness captive, Out of Our Heads is a fresh attempt at understanding our minds and how we interact with the world around us.},

"It is something we do." In "Action in Perception," Noe argues that perception and perceptual consciousness depend on capacities for action and thought--that perception is a kind of thoughtful activity. Touch, not vision, should be our model for perception. Perception is not a process in the brain, but a kind of skillful activity of the body as a whole. We enact our perceptual experience.To perceive, according to this enactive approach to perception, is not merely to have sensations; it is to have sensations that we understand. In "Action in Perception," Noe investigates the forms this understanding can take. He begins by arguing, on both phenomenological and empirical grounds, that the content of perception is not like the content of a picture; the world is not given to consciousness all at once but is gained gradually by active inquiry and exploration. Noe then argues that perceptual experience acquires content thanks to our possession and exercise of practical bodily knowledge, and examines, among other topics, the problems posed by spatial content and the experience of color. He considers the perspectival aspect of the representational content of experience and assesses the place of thought and understanding in experience. Finally, he explores the implications of the enactive approach for our understanding of the neuroscience of perception.},

	doi = {10.1109/CEC.2009.4983129},
	abstract = {Despite their success as optimization methods, evolutionary algorithms face many difficulties to design artifacts with complex structures. According to paleontologists, living organisms evolved by opportunistically co-opting characters adapted to a function to solve new problems, a phenomenon called exaptation. In this paper, we draw the hypotheses (1) that exaptation requires the presence of multiple selection pressures, (2) that Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) can create such pressures and (3) that the modularity of the genotype is a key to enable exaptation. To explore these hypotheses, we designed an evolutionary process to find the structure and the parameters of neural networks to compute a Boolean function with a modular structure. We then analyzed the role of each component using a Shapley value analysis. Our results show that: (1) the proposed method is efficient to evolve neural networks to solve this task; (2) genotypic modules and multiple selections gradients needed to be aligned to converge faster than the control experiments. This prominent role of multiple selection pressures contradicts the basic assumption that underlies most published modular methods for the evolution of neural networks, in which only the modularity of the genotype is considered.},

By contrast understanding organizations as complex social systems and co-creating enabling environments using the principles of complexity can bring about fundamental change. There is no 'black box' or magic in this process; It is simply a matter of addressing complex challenges in an appropriate way. However to do this effectively implies a shift in perspective and a different way of thinking. This is what can bring about changes in relationships, In behavior, and in organizational culture. The paper uses five different studies to argue that such understanding is essential; While at the same time illustrating some tools and methods used to identify the problem-space And that complex problems can only be addressed effectively by creating multi-dimensional enabling environments, Which address all the inter-related dimensions at the same time.},

Thisbrief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and alsoenables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses indepth on a small set of important and interesting topics -- particularly in machine learning,scientific modeling, and artificial life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including the workof Mitchell and her colleagues.The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyondthe strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory,molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting"general purpose" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed acrossdisciplines.An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in anyscientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforcethe reader's understanding of the text.The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and theirterminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters lookat the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis andprediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, andculture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory ofgenetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes upimplementation, and the last chapter poses some currently unanswered questions and surveys prospectsfor the future of evolutionary computation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1628},
	abstract = {This work introduces a general multi-level model for self-adaptive systems. A self-adaptive system is seen as composed by two levels: the lower level describing the actual behaviour of the system and the upper level accounting for the dynamically changing environmental constraints on the system. In order to keep our description as general as possible, the lower level is modelled as a state machine and the upper level as a second-order state machine whose states have associated formulas over observable variables of the lower level. Thus, each state of the second-order machine identifies the set of lower-level states satisfying the constraints. Adaptation is triggered when a second-order transition is performed; this means that the current system no longer can satisfy the current high-level constraints and, thus, it has to adapt its behaviour by reaching a state that meets the new constraints. The semantics of the multi-level system is given by a flattened transition system that can be statically checked in order to prove the correctness of the adaptation model. To this aim we formalize two concepts of weak and strong adaptability providing both a relational and a logical characterization. We report that this work gives a formal computational characterization of multi-level self-adaptive systems, evidencing the important role that (theoretical) computer science could play in the emerging science of complex systems.},

Both structural and functional human brain graphs have consistently demonstrated key topological properties such as small-worldness, modularity, and heterogeneous degree distributions. Brain graphs are also physically embedded so as to nearly minimize wiring cost, a key geometric property.

	abstract = {Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called "Divide-and-Conquer"), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many new exercises and problems have been added for this edition. As of the third edition, this textbook is published exclusively by the MIT Press.The hardcover edition does not include a dust jacket.},

	abstract = {Two great trends are evident in the evolution of life on Earth: towards increasing diversification and towards increasing integration. Diversification has spread living processes across the planet, progressively increasing the range of environments and free energy sources exploited by life. Integration has proceeded through a stepwise process in which living entities at one level are integrated into cooperative groups that become larger-scale entities at the next level, and so on, producing cooperative organizations of increasing scale (for example, cooperative groups of simple cells gave rise to the more complex eukaryote cells, groups of these gave rise to multi-cellular organisms, and cooperative groups of these organisms produced animal societies). The trend towards increasing integration has continued during human evolution with the progressive increase in the scale of human groups and societies. The trends towards increasing diversification and integration are both driven by selection. An understanding of the trajectory and causal drivers of the trends suggests that they are likely to culminate in the emergence of a global entity. This entity would emerge from the integration of the living processes, matter, energy and technology of the planet into a global cooperative organization. Such an integration of the results of previous diversifications would enable the global entity to exploit the widest possible range of resources across the varied circumstances of the planet. This paper demonstrates that it's case for directionality meets the tests and criticisms that have proven fatal to previous claims for directionality in evolution.},

The rational model, however, ignores the inherent complexity and ambiguity of real-world organizations and their environments. Karl E. Weick's new landmark volume, Sensemaking in Organizations, highlights how the "sensemaking" process--the creation of reality as an ongoing accomplishment that takes form when people make retrospective sense of the situations in which they find themselves--shapes organizational structure and behavior. Some of the topics Weick thoroughly covers are the concept, uniqueness, historical roots, varieties and occasions, general properties, and the future of sensemaking research and practice.

It's a general, empirically grounded account of sensemaking that goes significantly beyond the myths and puts forward some nonobvious, testable hypotheses about the process. When people try to make sense of events, they begin with some perspective, viewpoint, or framework - however minimal. For now, let's use a metaphor and call this a frame. We can express frames in various meaningful forms, including stories, maps, organizational diagrams, or scripts, and can use them in subsequent and parallel processes. Even though frames define what count as data, they themselves actually shape the data Furthermore, frames change as we acquire data. In other words, this is a two-way street: Frames shape and define the relevant data, and data mandate that frames change in nontrivial ways. We examine five areas of empirical findings: causal reasoning, commitment to hypotheses, feedback and learning, sense-making as a skill, and confirmation bias. In each area the Data/Frame model, and the research it's based on, doesn't align with common beliefs. For that reason, the Data/Frame model cannot be considered a depiction of commonsense views},

	abstract = {The integrated information theory (IIT) starts from phenomenology and makes use of thought experiments to claim that consciousness is integrated information. Specifically: (i) the quantity of consciousness corresponds to the amount of integrated information generated by a complex of elements; (ii) the quality of experience is specified by the set of informational relationships generated within that complex. Integrated information (Φ) is defined as the amount of information generated by a complex of elements, above and beyond the information generated by its parts. Qualia space (Q) is a space where each axis represents a possible state of the complex, each point is a probability distribution of its states, and arrows between points represent the informational relationships among its elements generated by causal mechanisms (connections). Together, the set of informational relationships within a complex constitute a shape in Q that completely and univocally specifies a particular experience. Several observations concerning the neural substrate of consciousness fall naturally into place within the IIT framework. Among them are the association of consciousness with certain neural systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes underlying consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes that remain unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless sleep and generalized seizures; and the distinct role of different cortical architectures in affecting the quality of experience. Equating consciousness with integrated information carries several implications for our view of nature.},

	shorttitle = {The social construction of consciousness. {Part} 1},
	abstract = {This paper outlines, from a sociological and social psychological perspective, a theoretical framework with which to define and analyse consciousness, emphasizing the importance of language, collective representations, conceptions of self, and self-reflectivity in understanding human consciousness. It argues that the shape and feel of consciousness is heavily social, and this is no less true of our experience of collective consciousness than it is of our experience of individual consciousness. The paper is divided into two parts. Part One argues that the problem of consciousness can be approached fruitfully by beginning with human group and collective phenomena: community, language, language-based communication, institutional and cultural arrangements, collective representations, self-conceptions, and self-referentiality. A collective is understood as a group or population of individuals (or collective agents as members) that possesses or develops collective representations of itself: its values and goals, its structure and modes of operating, its strategies, developments, strengths and weaknesses, etc. Collective reflectivity emerges as a function of an organization or group producing and making use of collective representations of the self (‘we’, our group, community, organization, nation) in its discussions, critical reflections, and planning. A collective monitors its activities, achievements and failures, and reflects on itself as a defined and on-going collective being. In this perspective, human consciousness is understood as a type of reflective activity: observing, monitoring, judging and re-orienting and re-organizing self; considering what characterizes the self, what self perceives, judges, could do, should do (or should not do). The reflectivity is encoded in language and developed in conversations about collective (as well as individual) selves. Part Two of the paper applies the framework to analysing the individual experience of consciousness, self-representation, self-reference, self-reflectivity and self-development.},

The paper focuses on the social origins of conscious phenomena, on collective as well as individual levels. Part 1 of the paper (Burns and Engdahl, 1998a) dealt with collective consciousness. This second part analyses individual consciousness as arising in the context of a person experiencing herself as an object of collective representation and collective reflection and discourse. Individual consciousness is the outcome of processes of collective naming, classifying, monitoring, judging, reflecting on, and conducting discussions and discourses about, the individual herself. A participant learns in the collective context (in line with George Herbert Mead's earlier formulations) a naming and classification of herself (self-description and identity), of her judgments, actions, and predispositions. In acquiring a language and conceptual framework for this mode of activity -- along with experience and skills in reflective discussion -- she develops a capability of inner reflection and inner dialogue about self, which are characteristic features of individual consciousness. The analysis goes on to distinguish multiple modes of individual awareness and consciousness, distinguishing awareness from consciousness proper, and also identifying pre- and sub-conscious levels. This points up the complexity of the human mind, in part its elaboration through processes of social interaction and construction.},

	abstract = {Evolution's Arrow argues that evolution is directional and progressive, and that this has major consequences for humanity. Without resort to teleology, the book demonstrates that evolution moves in the direction of producing cooperative organisations of greater scale and evolvability - evolution has organised molecular processes into cells, cells into organisms, and organisms into societies. The book founds this position on a new theory of the evolution of cooperation. It shows that self-interest at the level of the genes does not prevent cooperation from increasing as evolution unfolds. Evolution progresses by discovering ways to build cooperative organisations out of self-interested individuals. The book also shows that evolution itself has evolved. Evolution has progressively improved the ability of evolutionary mechanisms to discover effective adaptations. And it has produced new and better mechanisms. Evolution's Arrow uses this understanding of the direction of evolution to identify the next great steps in the evolution of life on earth - the steps that humanity must take if we are to continue to be successful in evolutionary terms. A key step for humanity is to increase the scale and evolvability of our societies, eventually forming a unified and cooperative society on the scale of the planet. We must also transform ourselves psychologically to become self-evolving organisms - organisms that are able to escape their biological and cultural past by adapting in whatever directions are necessary to achieve future evolutionary success.},

	shorttitle = {Imagining a complex world},
	url = {http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/64044},
	abstract = {How order is understood has been a central preoccupation of international relations theory. Within the Western imagination, order, banishing chaos, emerged from the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment as a knowable and calculable concept. Order became a known entity; it is the rational world. The irrational, that which didn’t fit into neat delineations, was to be shunned. The resultant scientific method came to represent a reductionist, linear, and predictable outlook. Although it subsequently stepped down from its positivist heights, this Newtonian paradigm continues to inform (whether in opposition or in support) theory construction within social sciences, and, by extension, international relations theory. However, for over a century the sciences, divorced from the social sciences, have moved beyond this paradigm, with considerable attention being directed to the non-linear sciences. From this family of new sciences, complexity theory, drawing on and displacing chaos theory, has emerged over the last two decades as a genuine paradigmatic alternative.
This thesis argues that the incorporation of complexity theory at the meta-theoretical levels offers the opportunity to reconsider ontological and epistemological assumptions within the study of global politics. In detailing the presuppositions that best capture a complexity worldview, it is argued that complex adaptive systems, like the international system, exhibit emergent properties. Irreducibility, sensitivity to initial conditions, and self-organisation are shown to be central to comprehending how complex systems evolve, adapt and maintain highenergy far-from-equilibrium processes. Conversely, it is argued that dominant rationalist-based theories of international relations continue to seek out theories of natural equilibrium, which often reflect a transference of the Newtonian paradigm via a neoclassical economic ontology. Instead, it is argued that the international system should be viewed as a series of nested and overlapping complex adaptive systems that contains significant points of attraction, the most recognisable being the state. Moving towards an acceptance of the impact of the non-linear sciences at the meta-theoretical level will press the importance of intuition and interpretation to theories of international relations. Moreover, theories that absorb this commitment will more easily escape accusations of either irrelevancy for lacking a scientific base or of suffering from ‘physics envy’, in its traditional guise, because of its scientific base.},

His path-breaking collection takes research on thinking, social intelligence, creativity, and decision-making out of an ethereal world where the laws of logic and probability reign, and places it into our real world of human behavior and interaction. Adaptive Thinking is accessibly written for general readers with an interest in psychology, cognitive science, economics, sociology, philosophy, artificial intelligence, and animal behavior.

This volume collects recent articles, looking at how people use "fast and frugal heuristics" to calculate probability and risk and make decisions.

Its appeal is to a mixture of cognitive psychologists, philosophers, economists, and others who study decision making.

	abstract = {What is involved, in practice, coming to a judgement? The Norwegian family therapist, Tom Andersen, characterized himself as 'a wanderer and worrier', he was constantly reflecting on his ways of ‘going on’, on his own practice, to further develop and refine them. Each new way came to him, he said, on reaching a ‘crossroads’, a point when he felt unable to continue any longer in the same way. But once he stopped doing what he had come to see as ethically wrong, he found, he said, that the 'alternatives popped up almost by themselves' (Anderson/Jensen, 2007: 159). What I want to discuss is the fact that, while we can say that we can quite self-consciously and deliberately decide not to do something (perhaps never again) at a particular moment, in a new and particular situation we cannot be said to decide at any particular instant in time, positively what to do. New ways of acting cannot be planned; they have to emerge. As Lehrer (2009) suggests, coming to act in a way that seems to be for the best in a particular situation is not something we can decide upon simply within ourselves – judgmental work, in which we go out bodily, to relate ourselves imaginatively and feelingfully to various aspects of our current circumstances, aspect-by-aspect, sequentially, over time, seems to be required. It is what the nature of this imaginative judgmental work feels like, looks like, and sounds like that I want to discuss in this paper.},

The book contains many new computer-based examples designed for Ljung's market-leading software, System Identification Toolbox for MATLAB.   Ljung combines careful mathematics, a practical understanding of real-world applications, and extensive exercises. He introduces both black-box and tailor-made models of linear as well as non-linear systems, and he describes principles, properties, and algorithms for a variety of identification techniques:    Nonparametric time-domain and frequency-domain methods.   Parameter estimation methods in a general prediction error setting.   Frequency domain data and frequency domain interpretations.   Asymptotic analysis of parameter estimates.   Linear regressions, iterative search methods, and other ways to compute estimates.   Recursive (adaptive) estimation techniques.    Ljung also presents detailed coverage of the key issues that can make or break system identification projects, such as defining objectives, designing experiments, controlling the bias distribution of transfer-function estimates, and carefully validating the resulting models.  The first edition of System Identification has been the field's most widely cited reference for over a decade.

In the current practice of spectral analysis, subjective decisions have to be made all of which influence the final spectral estimate and mean that different analysts obtain different results from the same stationary stochastic observations. Statistical signal processing can overcome this difficulty, producing a unique solution for any set of observations but that solution is only acceptable if it is close to the best attainable accuracy for most types of stationary data. Automatic Autocorrelation and Spectral Analysis describes a method which fulfils the above near-optimal-solution criterion. It takes advantage of greater computing power and robust algorithms to produce enough candidate models to be sure of providing a suitable candidate for given data. Improved order selection quality guarantees that one of the best (and often the best) will be selected automatically. The data themselves suggest their best representation. Should the analyst wish to intervene, alternatives can be provided. Written for graduate signal processing students and for researchers and engineers using time series analysis for practical applications ranging from breakdown prevention in heavy machinery to measuring lung noise for medical diagnosis, this text offers:   • tuition in how power spectral density and the autocorrelation function of stochastic data can be estimated and interpreted in time series models; • extensive support for the MATLAB® ARMAsel toolbox; • applications showing the methods in action; • appropriate mathematics for students to apply the methods with references for those who wish to develop them further.},

Both fields study epistemic relations, but whereas artificial intelligence approaches this subject from the perspective of understanding formal and computational properties of frameworks purporting to model some epistemic relation or other, traditional epistemology approaches the subject from the perspective of understanding the properties of epistemic relations in terms of their conceptual properties. We argue that these two practices should not be conducted in isolation. We illustrate this point by discussing how to represent a class of inference forms found in standard inferential statistics. This class of inference forms is interesting because its members share two properties that are common to epistemic relations, namely defeasibility and paraconsistency. Our modeling of standard inferential statistical arguments exploits results from both logical artificial intelligence and analytical epistemology. We remark how our approach to this modeling problem may be generalized to an interdisciplinary approach to the study of epistemic relations.},

http://2012.singularitysummit.com.au/2012/08/universal-artificial-intelligence/
Abstract: The approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the last century may be labelled as (a) trying to understand and copy (human)
nature, (b) being based on heuristic considerations, (c) being formal but from the outset (provably) limited, (d) being (mere)
frameworks that leave crucial aspects unspecified. This decade has spawned the first theory of AI, which (e) is principled, formal,
complete, and general. This theory, called Universal AI, is about ultimate super-intelligence. It can serve as a gold standard for
General AI, and implicitly proposes a formal definition of machine intelligence. After a brief review of the various approaches to
(general) AI, I will give an introduction to Universal AI, concentrating on the philosophical, mathematical, and computational
aspects behind it. I will also discuss various implications and future challenges.

	abstract = {What is Intelligence?
Intelligence is a very difficult concept (maybe thats the reason why many people try to avoid it or narrow it down).  I've worked on this question for many many years now, and we went through the literature; psychology literature, philosophy literature; AI literature) what individuals, researches, and also groups came up with definitions, they are very diverse.  But there seems to be one redcurrant theme and if you wnat to put it in one sentence,  then you could define intelligence as:
"an agents ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments", or to succeed in a wide range of environments.  
If you now look at this sentence and ask, "wow, how can this single sentence capture the complexity of intelligence?"  There are two answers to that. First: many aspect of that are emergent properties of intelligence, like being able to learn - if I want to succeed or solve a problem I need to acquire new knowledge, so learning is an emergent phenomenon this definition.
And the second answer is: this is just a sentence that contains a few words, what you really have to do, and that's the hard part, is to transform it into meaningful equations and then study these equations.  And that's what I have done in the last 12 years.

Bounded Rationality:
It is an interesting question whether resource bounds should be included in any definition of intelligence or not, and the natural answer is of course they should.  Well there are several problems, the first one is that nobody ever came up with a reasonable theory of bounded rationality (people have tried), so it seems to be very hard.  And this is not specific to AI or intelligence, but it seems to be symptomatic in science, so if you look at the several fields (physics the crown discipline) theories have been developed: Neuton's mechanics, General Relativity Theory, Quantum Field theory, the Standard Model of Particle Physics.  there are more and more precise, but they get less and less computable, and having a computable theory is not a principle in developing these theories, of course at some point you have to test these theories and you want to do something with them, and then you need a computable theory - this is a very difficult issue (and you have to approximate them or do something about it). But having computational resources built into the fundamentals of the theories, that is at least in physics, and if you look at other disciplines, that is not how things work.
You design theories so that they describe your phenomenon as well as possible and the computational aspect is secondary.  Of course if it is incomputable and you can't do anything with it, you have to come up with another theory, but this always comes second.  And only in computer science (and this comes naturally) computer scientists try to think about how they can design an efficient algorithm to solve my problem, and since AI is sitting in the computer science department traditionally, the mainstream thought is "how can I build a resource bounded artificial intelligent system".  And I agree that ultimately this is what we want.   But the problem is so hard I think, that we should take (or a large fraction of the scientists) this approach, model the problem first, define the problem first, and once we are confident that we have solved this problem, then go to the second phase, try to approximate the theory, try to make a computational theory out of it. And then there are many many possibilities, you could still try to create a resource bounded theory of intelligence, which will be very very hard if you want to have it very principled, or you do some heuristics... or .. or .. or... many options.  Or the short answer may be I am not smart enough to come up with a resource bounded theory of intelligence, therefore I only developed one without resource constraints (that would be the short answer).

AIXI:
Ok so now we have this informal definition that intelligence is an agents ability to succeed or achieve goals in a wide range of environments.  The point is you can formalize this theory, and we have done that and it is called AIXI.  Or Universal AI is the general field theory and AIXI is the particular agent which acts optimally in this sense. 
So that works as follows: it has a planning component, and it has a learning component.  What the learning component does is, think about a robot walking around in the environment, and at the beginning it has no data/knowledge about the world, so what it has to do is acquire data/knowledge of the world and then build its own model of the world, how the world works.  And it does that, so there are very powerful general theories on how to learn a model from data, from very complex scenarios.  This theory is rooted in Kolomogrov complexity, algorithmic information theory - the basic idea is you look for the simplest model which describe your data efficiently well.},

Here we present a formal approach resulting from the convergence of theoretical morphology and network theory that allows constructing a 3D morphospace of hierarchies and hence comparing the hierarchical organization of ecological, cellular, technological, and social networks. Embedded within large voids in the morphospace of all possible hierarchies, four major groups are identified. Two of them match the expected from random networks with similar connectivity, thus suggesting that nonadaptive factors are at work. Ecological and gene networks define the other two, indicating that their topological order is the result of functional constraints. These results are consistent with an exploration of the morphospace, using in silico evolved networks.},

Accordingly a node is critical, intermittent or redundant if it acts as a driver node in all, some or none of the control configurations. Here we develop an analytical framework to identify the category of each node, leading to the discovery of two distinct control modes in complex systems: centralized versus distributed control. We predict the control mode for an arbitrary network and show that one can alter it through small structural perturbations. The uncovered bimodality has implications from network security to organizational research and offers new insights into the dynamics and control of complex systems.},

Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system’s entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network’s degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

The novel contribution presented is to gauge the simplicity of an entity in terms of the ease of communicating it within a community of embodied agents (the so-called embodied communication prior or ECP). Augmented by some further assumptions about the statistical structure of communicated knowledge, this choice is seen to lead to a model of intelligence in terms of distinct but interacting memory and cognitive subsystems dealing with procedural, declarative, sensory/episodic, attentional and intentional knowledge. A sister paper then extends these ideas to yield a "cognitive synergy theory" that suggests specific conclusions for the architecture of artificial general intelligences, based on the ECP.},

This problem is relevant to a wide range of fields and is integral to the philosophy of science. It has been tackled by many great minds ranging from philosophers to scientists to mathematicians, and more recently computer scientists. In this article we argue the case for Solomonoff Induction, a formal inductive framework which combines algorithmic information theory with the Bayesian framework. Although it achieves excellent theoretical results and is based on solid philosophical foundations, the requisite technical knowledge necessary for understanding this framework has caused it to remain largely unknown and unappreciated in the wider scientific community. The main contribution of this article is to convey Solomonoff induction and its related concepts in a generally accessible form with the aim of bridging this current technical gap. In the process we examine the major historical contributions that have led to the formulation of Solomonoff Induction as well as criticisms of Solomonoff and induction in general. In particular we examine how Solomonoff induction addresses many issues that have plagued other inductive systems, such as the black ravens paradox and the confirmation problem, and compare this approach with other recent approaches.},

The focus is on applying our knowledge of development in natural cognitive systems, specifically human infants, to the problem of creating artificial cognitive systems in the guise of humanoid robots. The approach is founded on the three-fold premise that (a) cognition is the process by which an autonomous self-governing agent acts effectively in the world in which it is embedded, (b) the dual purpose of cognition is to increase the agent's repertoire of effective actions and its power to anticipate the need for future actions and their outcomes, and (c) development plays an essential role in the realization of these cognitive capabilities. Our goal in this book is to identify the key design principles for cognitive development. We do this by bringing together insights from four areas: enactive cognitive science, developmental psychology, neurophysiology, and computational modelling. This results in roadmap comprising a set of forty-three guidelines for the design of a cognitive architecture and its deployment in a humanoid robot.

More pragmatic approach to artificial general intelligence is based on cognitive architectures, which are, however, non-universal in sense that they can construct and use models of the environment only from Turing-incomplete model spaces. We believe that the way to the real AGI consists in bridging the gap between these two approaches. This is possible if one considers cognitive functions as a "cognitive bias" (priors and search heuristics) that should be incorporated into the models of universal algorithmic intelligence without violating their universality. Earlier reported results suiting this approach and its overall feasibility are discussed on the example of perception, planning, knowledge representation, attention, theory of mind, language, and some others.},

	abstract = {Bayesian methods since the time of Laplace have been understood by their practitioners as closely aligned to the scientific method. Indeed a recent champion of Bayesian methods, E. T. Jaynes, titled his textbook on the subject Probability Theory: the Logic of Science. Many philosophers of science including Karl Popper and Donald Campbell have interpreted the evolution of Science as a Darwinian process consisting of a 'copy with selective retention' algorithm abstracted from Darwin's theory of Natural Selection. Arguments are presented for an isomorphism between Bayesian Methods and Darwinian processes. Universal Darwinism, as the term has been developed by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore, is the collection of scientific theories which explain the creation and evolution of their subject matter as due to the operation of Darwinian processes. These subject matters span the fields of atomic physics, chemistry, biology and the social sciences. The principle of Maximum Entropy states that systems will evolve to states of highest entropy subject to the constraints of scientific law. This principle may be inverted to provide illumination as to the nature of scientific law. Our best cosmological theories suggest the universe contained much less complexity during the period shortly after the Big Bang than it does at present. The scientific subject matter of atomic physics, chemistry, biology and the social sciences has been created since that time. An explanation is proposed for the existence of this subject matter as due to the evolution of constraints in the form of adaptations imposed on Maximum Entropy. It is argued these adaptations were discovered and instantiated through the operations of a succession of Darwinian processes.},

	abstract = {Two new formal definitions of intelligence are presented, the ”pragmatic general intelligence ” and ”efficient pragmatic general intelligence. ” Largely inspired by Legg and Hutter’s formal definition of ”universal intelligence, ” the goal of these definitions is to capture a notion of general intelligence that more closely models that possessed by humans and practical AI systems, which combine an element of universality with a certain degree of specialization to particular environments and goals. Pragmatic general intelligence measures the capability of an agent to achieve goals in environments, relative to prior distributions over goal and environment space. Efficient pragmatic general intelligences measures this same capability, but normalized by the amount of computational resources utilized in the course of the goal-achievement. A methodology is described for estimating these theoretical quantities based on observations of a real biological or artificial system operating in a real environment. Finally, a measure of the ”degree of generality ” of an intelligent system is presented, allowing a rigorous distinction between ”general AI ” and ”narrow AI.”},

Our approach is based on a direct approximation of AIXI, a Bayesian optimality notion for general reinforcement learning agents. Previously, it has been unclear whether the theory of AIXI could motivate the design of practical algorithms. We answer this hitherto open question in the affirmative, by providing the first computationally feasible approximation to the AIXI agent. To develop our approximation, we introduce a new Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm along with an agent-specific extension to the Context Tree Weighting algorithm. Empirically, we present a set of encouraging results on a variety of stochastic and partially observable domains. We conclude by proposing a number of directions for future research.},

After defining the key concepts of blind variants, creative thought, and disciplinary context, the combinatorial models are specified in terms of individual domain samples, variable field size, ideational combination, and disciplinary communication. Empirical implications are then derived with respect to individual, domain, and field systems. These abstract combinatorial models are next provided substantive reinforcement with respect to findings concerning the cognitive processes, personality traits, developmental factors, and social contexts that contribute to creativity. The review concludes with some suggestions regarding future efforts to explicate creativity according to BVSR theory.},

	abstract = {Despite all our great advances in science, technology and financial innovations, many societies today are struggling with a financial, economic and public spending crisis, over-regulation, and mass unemployment, as well as lack of sustainability and innovation. Can we still rely on conventional economic thinking or do we need a new approach? I argue that, as the complexity of socio-economic systems increases, networked decision-making and bottom-up self-regulation will be more and more important features. It will be explained why, besides the "homo economicus" with strictly self-regarding preferences, natural selection has also created a "homo socialis" with other-regarding preferences. While the "homo economicus" optimizes the own prospects in separation, the decisions of the "homo socialis" are self-determined, but interconnected, a fact that may be characterized by the term "networked minds". Notably, the "homo socialis" manages to earn higher payoffs than the "homo economicus". I show that the "homo economicus" and the "homo socialis" imply a different kind of dynamics and distinct aggregate outcomes. Therefore, next to the traditional economics for the "homo economicus" ("economics 1.0"), a complementary theory must be developed for the "homo socialis". This economic theory might be called "economics 2.0" or "socionomics". The names are justified, because the Web 2.0 is currently promoting a transition to a new market organization, which benefits from social media platforms and could be characterized as "participatory market society". To thrive, the "homo socialis" requires suitable institutional settings such a particular kinds of reputation systems, which will be sketched in this paper. I also propose a new kind of money, so-called "qualified money", which may overcome some of the problems of our current financial system.},

This paper presents research on cellular automata which suggests that the optimal conditions for the support of information transmission, storage, and modification, are achieved in the vicinity of a phase transition. We observe surprising similarities between the behaviors of computations and systems near phase transitions, finding analogs of computational complexity classes and the halting problem within the phenomenology of phase transitions.
We conclude that there is a fundamental connection between computation and phase transitions, especially second-order or “critical” transitions, and discuss some of the implications for our understanding of nature if such a connection is borne out.},

	abstract = {In an algorithmic artificial chemistry the objects (molecules) are data and the interactions (reactions) among them are defined by an algorithm. The same object can appear in two forms: (1) as a machine (operator) or (2) as data (operand). Thus, the same object can, on the one hand, process other objects or, on the other hand, it can be processed. This dualism enables to implicitly define a constructive artificial chemistry which exhibits quite complex behavior. Remarkably, even evolutionary behavior emerged in our experiments, without defining any explicit variation operators or fitness-function. In addition to microscopic methods (e.g., monitoring the actions of single molecules) and macroscopic measures (e.g., diversity or complexity) we developed a stepwise mesoscopic analysis method based on classification and dynamic clustering. Knowledge about the system is accumulated by an iterative process in which measuring tools (classificators) extract information which i...},

He argues persuasively that emotions, intuitions, and feelings are not distinct things, but different ways of thinking.   By examining these different forms of mind activity, Minsky says, we can explain why our thought sometimes takes the form of carefully reasoned analysis and at other times turns to emotion. He shows how our minds progress from simple, instinctive kinds of thought to more complex forms, such as consciousness or self-awareness. And he argues that because we tend to see our thinking as fragmented, we fail to appreciate what powerful thinkers we really are. Indeed, says Minsky, if thinking can be understood as the step-by-step process that it is, then we can build machines -- artificial intelligences -- that not only can assist with our thinking by thinking as we do but have the potential to be as conscious as we are.   Eloquently written, The Emotion Machine is an intriguing look into a future where more powerful artificial intelligences await.},

In Strategic Navigation: a Systems Approach to Business Strategy, best-selling author H. William Dettmer explains how sound, proven strategies used by great military leaders from Sun Tzu to Schwarzkopf can also be easily and effectively used in the business world. Dettmer begins the book by introducing the conceptual framework of military strategy and maneuver warfare, which dates back over 2,300 years to the time of Sun Tzues the Art of War. He first explains how the time-tested principles of war planning and military execution can be readily applied to non-military uses, such as commercial business, not-for-profit organizations, and government agencies, leading to considerable benefits in coherence and focus. Dettmer then introduces a logical, systematic tool set to help you translate the military strategy etemplatee into action, which can then be applied to nearly any industry or business type. the system described by Dettmer is quick and easy to use, flexible enough to accommodate changes in the external environment, and supports the creativity of both strategists and executors.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Synaptic plasticity is the capacity of a preexisting connection between two neurons to change in strength as a function of neuronal activity. Because it admittedly underlies learning and memory, the elucidation of its constituting mechanisms is of crucial importance in many aspects of normal and pathological brain function. Short-term presynaptic plasticity refers to changes occurring over short time scales (milliseconds to seconds) that are mediated by frequency-dependent modifications of the amount of neurotransmitter released by presynaptic stimulation. Recent experiments have reported that glial cells, especially hippocampal astrocytes, can modulate short-term plasticity, but the mechanism of such modulation is poorly understood. Here, we explore a plausible form of modulation of short-term plasticity by astrocytes using a biophysically realistic computational model. Our analysis indicates that astrocytes could simultaneously affect synaptic release in two ways. First, they either decrease or increase the overall synaptic release of neurotransmitter. Second, for stimuli that are delivered as pairs within short intervals, they systematically increase or decrease the synaptic response to the second one. Hence, our model suggests that astrocytes could transiently trigger switches between paired-pulse depression and facilitation. This property explains several challenging experimental observations and has a deep impact on our understanding of synaptic information transfer.},

	volume = {3},
	url = {http://www.kli.ac.at/theorylab/Fulltext/campbell/campbell.html},
	abstract = {This paper originated in a set of background readings assembled by Donald T. Campbell (DTC) for a talk at a meeting entitled "The Epistemology Group: The Evolution of Knowledge and Invention". The meeting was organized by John Ziman, and took place on 24 May 1995, at The Royal Society of Arts, London. The editors of Evolution and Cognition encouraged DTC to develop the manuscript for publication, and in his notes on the version completed before his death, DTC described it as "in a halfway state of editing", and as "a personalized retrospective history of ideas". He also wrote that "The main goal of the paper is to provide a naturalistic epistemology for science. It turns out that this will have to also be a sociology of scientific validity. Fragmentary suggestions along this line take up much of the space." DTC pursued this goal first by identifying the type of evolutionary epistemology in which he was engaged as 'general selection theory' (section 1). Rather than focussing on the biological evolutionary origins of categories of perception and thought, exploring detailed analogies between biological evolution and scientific change, or examining the role of innate perceptual mechanisms in language acquisition, general selection theory asserts that variation-and-selective-retention processes operate at a number of hierarchically organized loci or domains in nature, and that all improvements in 'fit' between systems and their environments are attributable to the operation of these selection processes.         Section 2 provides further preliminary clarification. Therein DTC announces that he now believes it counterproductive to describe adaptive organic form, resulting from genetic selection, as 'knowledge'. Instead, the term 'knowledge' should be reserved for the products of vicarious selection processes, such as perception, trial-and-error learning, and scientific enquiry, that "short-cut selection by the life and death of genetic variants".         Sections 3-6 examine the implications of general selection theory for the status of scientific knowledge and justification. Throughout, DTC emphasizes that the realization that science proceeds through selection processes does not provide justification for scientific beliefs or theories, and, in this sense, general selection theory is "epistemologically irrelevant". He underlines this sceptical point in section 3 by noting that religious, as well as scientific, beliefs can be selection-based, and in section 4 by drawing attention to the many selection processes in science that are antagonistic to "competence of reference", i.e. correspondence truth of theories. Primary among these are the processes required to sustain science as a social system, as a "vehicle" or embodiment of knowledge. In sections 5 and 6, DTC continues to "side with the sceptics" by stressing the ubiquity and ineliminability of the problem of induction, and the oversimplification entailed by the use of language.         In the spirit of DTC's hypothetical realism, there is a switch of perspectives between sections 6 and 7. Having insisted in the first half of the text that general selection theory cannot justify scientific beliefs, and therefore that realism about those beliefs is necessarily hypothetical, or a matter or faith, DTC offers in the latter part of the text a selectionist rationale for greater trust in scientific than in religious beliefs (section 7), and argues that public commitment to the norms of science, even if it is hypocritical, functions to increase competence of reference (section 8). Thus, he shows that, if one assumes what cannot be demonstrated (using selection theory or by any other means), that science is (sometimes) successful in describing nature, selection theory can explain how this success could be achieved, and provide the basis for recommendations about how science should be organized to maintain or enhance the (presumed) validity of the beliefs it generates. In other words, those used in the title of the paper: one type of evolutionary epistemology, selection theory, yields a descriptive epistemology for science, and, more specifically, a sociology of scientific validity.},

	abstract = {This is an empirical study of rare leaders from business, government, and civil society with a developmentally mature meaning-making system, or late-stage action logic (Cook-Greuter, 1999; Loevinger, 1966, 1976; Torbert, 1987). It explores how they design and engage in sustainability initiatives. Participants were assessed for their action logic using a variation of the Washington University Sentence Completion Test (Loevinger \& Wessler, 1970). The sample has more leaders with documented, advanced meaning-making capacity than any other leadership study (six Strategists, five Alchemists, two Ironists). This study has significant implications for sustainability leadership theory and constructive- developmentalism. The results provide the most granular view to date of how such individuals may think and behave with respect to complex change initiatives. The leaders in this study appear to: (1) Design from a deep inner foundation, including grounding their work in transpersonal meaning; (2) Access non-rational ways of knowing, and use systems, complexity, and integral theories; and (3) Adaptively manage through “dialogue” with the system, three distinct roles, and developmental practices. Additional results include: 15 leadership competencies; developmental stage distinctions for six dimensions of leadership reflection and action; and 12 practices that differentiate leaders with a unitive perspective (Alchemists, Ironists) from those with a general systems perspective (Strategists). A constructive-developmental lens is shown to provide important insight for sustainability leadership theory. Finally, it is recommended that all leadership programs work to develop meaning-making capacity because of the enhanced abilities that emerge with each new stage.},

There is, however, a broad methodological foundation which is quickly becoming a prerequisite for researchers and practitioners working with network models. From a computer science perspective, network analysis is applied graph theory. Unlike standard graph theory books, the content of this book is organized according to methods for specific levels of analysis (element, group, network) rather than abstract concepts like paths, matchings, or spanning subgraphs. Its topics therefore range from vertex centrality to graph clustering and the evolution of scale-free networks. In 15 coherent chapters, this monograph-like tutorial book introduces and surveys the concepts and methods that drive network analysis, and is thus the first book to do so from a methodological perspective independent of specific application areas.},

	abstract = {Abstract Existential risks are those that threaten the entire future of humanity. Many theories of value imply that even relatively small reductions in net existential risk have enormous expected value. Despite their importance, issues surrounding human-extinction risks and related hazards remain poorly understood. In this article, I clarify the concept of existential risk and develop an improved classification scheme. I discuss the relation between existential risks and basic issues in axiology, and show how existential risk reduction (via the maxipok rule) can serve as a strongly action-guiding principle for utilitarian concerns. I also show how the notion of existential risk suggests a new way of thinking about the ideal of sustainability. Policy Implications * • Existential risk is a concept that can focus long-term global efforts and sustainability concerns. * • The biggest existential risks are anthropogenic and related to potential future technologies. * • A moral case can be made that existential risk reduction is strictly more important than any other global public good. * • Sustainability should be reconceptualised in dynamic terms, as aiming for a sustainable trajectory rather than a sustainable state. * • Some small existential risks can be mitigated today directly (e.g. asteroids) or indirectly (by building resilience and reserves to increase survivability in a range of extreme scenarios) but it is more important to build capacity to improve humanity’s ability to deal with the larger existential risks that will arise later in this century. This will require collective wisdom, technology foresight, and the ability when necessary to mobilise a strong global coordinated response to anticipated existential risks. * • Perhaps the most cost-effective way to reduce existential risks today is to fund analysis of a wide range of existential risks and potential mitigation strategies, with a long-term perspective.},

The occurrence of events is controlled by the "state" of the system, which can be described as a set of conditions. An immediate application of such a model is in the control structures of conventional programming languages. Control structures are the backbone of every programming language. In this paper, an equivalent functional Petri Net (FPN) model is developed for each of the three constructs of structured programs and a FPN Software prototype proposed for the conventional programming construct: if-then-else statement. The motivating idea is essentially to show that FPNs could be used as an alternative approach for program design.},

The many topics covered include consciousness in vision and inner speech, immediate memory and attention, waking, dreaming, coma, the effects of brain damage, fringe consciousness, hypnosis, and dissociation.Underlying all the selections are the questions, What difference does consciousness make? What are its properties? What role does it play in the nervous system? How do conscious brain functions differ from unconscious ones? The focus of the book is on scientific evidence and theory. The editors have also chosen introductory articles by leading scientists to allow a wide variety of new readers to gain insight into the field.},

Here consciousness is seen as a "stage" on which our sensations, perceptions, thoughts, and feelings play to a vast, silent audience (the immensely complicated inner-workings of the brain's unconscious processes). Behind the scenes, silent context operators shape conscious experience; they include implicit expectations, self systems, and scene setters. Using this framework, Baars presents compelling evidence that human consciousness rides on top of biologically ancient mechanisms. In humans it manifests itself in inner speech, imagery, perception, and voluntary control of thought and action. Topics like hypnosis, absorbed states of mind, adaptation to trauma, and the human propensity to project expectations on uncertainty, all fit into the expanded theater metaphor. As Baars explores our present understanding of the mind, he takes us to the top laboratories around the world, where we witness some of the field's most exciting breakthroughs and discoveries. And throughout the book, Baars has sprinkled numerous and often highly amusing on-the-spot demonstrations that illuminate the ideas under discussion.},

Then we introduce the fundamental principles and the successive steps that have been followed in the construction of the scale relativity theory, which aims at describing the effects of a non-differentiable and fractal (i.e., explicitly scale dependent) geometry of space-time. The first paper of this series was devoted, in this new framework, to the construction from first principles of scale laws of increasing complexity, and to the discussion of some tentative applications of these laws to biological systems. In this second review and perspective paper, we describe the effects induced by the internal fractal structures of trajectories on motion in standard space. Their main consequence is the transformation of classical dynamics into a generalized, quantum-like self-organized dynamics. A Schrödinger-type equation is derived as an integral of the geodesic equation in a fractal space. We then indicate how gauge fields can be constructed from a geometric re-interpretation of gauge transformations as scale transformations in fractal space-time. Finally, we introduce a new tentative development of the theory, in which quantum laws would hold also in scale space, introducing complexergy as a measure of organizational complexity. Initial possible applications of this extended framework to the processes of morphogenesis and the emergence of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular structures are discussed. Having founded elements of the evolutionary, developmental, biochemical and cellular theories on the first principles of scale relativity theory, we introduce proposals for the construction of an integrative theory of life and for the design and implementation of novel macroscopic quantum-type experiments and devices, and discuss their potential applications for the analysis, engineering and management of physical and biological systems and properties, and the consequences for the organization of transdisciplinary research and the scientific curriculum in the context of the SYSTEMOSCOPE Consortium research and development agenda.},

Then we introduce the fundamental principles and the successive steps that have been followed in the construction of the scale relativity theory, and discuss how scale laws of increasing complexity can be used to model and understand the behaviour of complex biological systems. In scale relativity theory, the geometry of space is considered to be continuous but non-differentiable, therefore fractal (i.e., explicitly scale-dependent). One writes the equations of motion in such a space as geodesics equations, under the constraint of the principle of relativity of all scales in nature. To this purpose, covariant derivatives are constructed that implement the various effects of the non-differentiable and fractal geometry. In this first review paper, the scale laws that describe the new dependence on resolutions of physical quantities are obtained as solutions of differential equations acting in the scale space. This leads to several possible levels of description for these laws, from the simplest scale invariant laws to generalized laws with variable fractal dimensions. Initial applications of these laws to the study of species evolution, embryogenesis and cell confinement are discussed.},

Particularly, S qualitatively outperforms the most commonly used criterion to define communities, Newman and Girvan's modularity (Q). Applying S maximization to real networks often provides natural, well-supported partitions, but also sometimes counterintuitive solutions that expose the limitations of our previous knowledge. These results indicate that it is possible to define an effective global criterion for community structure and open new routes for the understanding of complex networks.},

Computational advances have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications in a variety of fields. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of bio-warfare, from modeling consumer behavior to understanding the fall of ancient civilizations, to name a few.

	abstract = {We give a denotational framework (a meta model) within which certain properties of models of computation can be understood and compared. It describes concurrent processes as sets of possible behaviors. Compositions of processes are given as intersections of their behaviors. The interaction between processes is through signals, which are collections of events. Each event is a value-tag pair, where the tags can come from a partially ordered or totally ordered set. Timed models are where the set of tags is totally ordered. Synchronous events share the same tag, and synchronous signals contain events with the same set of tags. Synchronous systems contain synchronous signals. Strict causality (in timed systems) and continuity (in untimed systems) ensure determinacy under certain technical conditions. The framework is used to compare certain essential features of various models of computation, including Kahn process networks, dataflow, sequential processes, concurrent sequential processes with rendezvous, Petri nets, and discrete-event systems.},

"Groovy in Action" is a comprehensive guide to Groovy programming, introducing Java developers to the new dynamic features that Groovy provides. To bring you "Groovy in Action," Manning again went to the source by working with a team of expert authors including both members and the Manager of the Groovy Project team. The result is the true definitive guide to the new Groovy language.  "Groovy in Action" introduces Groovy by example, presenting lots of reusable code while explaining the underlying concepts. Java developers new to Groovy find a smooth transition into the dynamic programming world. Groovy experts gain a solid reference that challenges them to explore Groovy deeply and creatively.  Because Groovy is so new, most readers will be learning it from scratch. "Groovy in Action" quickly moves through the Groovy basics, including:  Simple and collective Groovy data types Working with Closures and Groovy Control Structures Dynamic Object Orientation, Groovy style  Readers are presented with rich and detailed examples illustrating Groovy's enhancements to Java, including How to Work with Builders and the GDK Database programming with Groovy  "Groovy in Action" then demonstrates how to Integrate Groovy with XML, and provides,  Tips and Tricks Unit Testing and Build Support Groovy on Windows  An additional bonus is a chapter dedicated to Grails, the Groovy Web Application Framework.

	abstract = {The process of learning requires morphological changes in the neuronal connections and the formation of new synapses. Due to the importance of memory and learning in our species, it has been suggested that the synaptic plasticity in a number of association areas is higher in the human brain than in other primates. Cortical neurons in mammals are characterized by higher metabolism, activity, and synaptic plasticity during development and the juvenile stage than in the adult. In Homo sapiens, brain development is retarded compared with other primates, especially in some association areas. These areas are characterized by the presence of neurons, which remain structurally immature throughout their lifespans and show an increase in the expression of the genes, which deal with metabolism and the activity and synaptic plasticity in adulthood. The retention of juvenile features in some adult neurons in our species has occurred in areas, which are related to episodic memory, planning, and social navigation. The increase of the aerobic metabolism in these neurons may lead, however, to higher levels of oxidative stress, therefore, favoring the development of neurodegenerative diseases which are exclusive, or almost exclusive, to humans, such as Alzheimer's disease.

The authors describe a new framework in which interactions, occurring at all levels, give rise to emergent forms and behaviors. These outcomes often may be highly constrained and universal, yet they are not themselves directly contained in the genes in any domain-specific way. One of the key contributions of Rethinking Innateness is a taxonomy of ways in which a behavior can be innate. These include constraints at the level of representation, architecture, and timing; typically, behaviors arise through the interaction of constraints at several of these levels. The ideas are explored through dynamic models inspired by a new kind of "developmental connectionism", a marriage of connectionist models and developmental neurobiology, forming a new theoretical framework for the study of behavioral development. While relying heavily on the conceptual and computational tools provided by connectionism, Rethinking Innateness also identifies ways in which these tools need to be enriched by closer attention to biology.},

This linear algebraic approach is widely accessible to scientists and engineers who may not be formally trained in computer science.

	abstract = {Motivation: The increasing number and complexity of biomodels makes automatic procedures for checking the models' properties and quality necessary. Approaches like elementary mode analysis, flux balance analysis, deficiency analysis and chemical organization theory (OT) require only the stoichiometric structure of the reaction network for derivation of valuable information. In formalisms like Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), however, information about the stoichiometric coefficients required for an analysis of chemical organizations can be hidden in kinetic laws. Results: First, we introduce an algorithm that uncovers stoichiometric information that might be hidden in the kinetic laws of a reaction network. This allows us to apply OT to SBML models using modifiers. Second, using the new algorithm, we performed a large-scale analysis of the 185 models contained in the manually curated BioModels Database. We found that for 41 models (22\%) the set of organizations changes when modifiers are considered correctly. We discuss one of these models in detail (BIOMD149, a combined model of the ERK-and Wnt-signaling pathways), whose set of organizations drastically changes when modifiers are considered. Third, we found inconsistencies in 5 models (3\%) and identified their characteristics. Compared with flux-based methods, OT is able to identify those species and reactions more accurately [in 26 cases (14\%)] that can be present in a long-term simulation of the model. We conclude that our approach is a valuable tool that helps to improve the consistency of biomodels and their repositories.

In the following sections we propose a set of possible answers to these questions.

The most central and complex symbol in your brain is the one called "I." The "I" is the nexus in our brain, one of many symbols seeming to have free will and to have gained the paradoxical ability to push particles around, rather than the reverse. How can a mysterious abstraction be real--or is our "I" merely a convenient fiction? Does an "I" exert genuine power over the particles in our brain, or is it helplessly pushed around by the laws of physics? These are the mysteries tackled in I Am a Strange Loop, Douglas Hofstadter's first book-length journey into philosophy since Godel, Escher, Bach.

Four classes of distinctions (patterns, states, rules, and values) and four classes of distinction processes (conservation, destruction, creation, and creation-and-destruction of distinctions) are defined. The resulting 4 x 4 grid is used to classify cognitive processes. This allows to model “non-rational” phenomena, such as creativity, emotions, mystical experiences,..., in a relatively simple way, as incompletely distinction conserving processes. 1.},

I propose a neurolinguistic approach to performativity that is based on John Searle's theory of institutions, especially his concept of a ‘status function’ and his explanation of rule-following as a neurophysiological disposition. Positing a status function is a performative act. I proceed in two steps to establish the neurolinguistic framework. First, I apply the concept of ‘conceptual blending’ borrowed from cognitive science on the status function, and give empirical applications from the research on performativity in financial markets. Second, I sketch the underlying neuroscience framework following the neural theory of metaphor, which I illustrate empirically with examples from behavioral finance and neuroeconomics.},

	abstract = {This book is about stochastic Petri nets (SPNs), which have proven to be a popular tool for modelling and performance analysis of complex discrete-event stochastic systems. The focus is on methods for modelling a system as an SPN with general firing times and for studying the long-run behavior of the resulting SPN model using computer simulation. Modelling techniques are illustrated in the context of computer, manufacturing, telecommunication, workflow, and transportation systems. The simulation discussion centers on the theory that underlies estimation procedures such as the regenerative method, the method of batch means, and spectral methods.Tying these topics together are conditions on the building blocks of an SPN under which the net is stable over time and specified estimation procedures are valid. In addition, the book develops techniques for comparing the modelling power of different discrete-event formalisms. These techniques provide a means for making principled choices between alternative modelling frameworks and also can be used to extend stability results and limit theorems from one framework to another. As an overview of fundamental modelling, stability, convergence, and estimation issues for discrete-event systems, this book will be of interest to researchers and graduate students in Applied Mathematics, Operations Research, Applied Probability, and Statistics. This book also will be of interest to practitioners of Industrial, Computer, Transportation, and Electrical Engineering, because it provides an introduction to a powerful set of tools both for modelling and for simulation-based performance analysis. Peter J. Haas is a member of the Research Staff at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California.

This leads to a novel approach to semantic representation in which word meanings are represented in terms of a set of probabilistic topics. The topic model performs well in predicting word association and the effects of semantic association and ambiguity on a variety of language-processing and memory tasks. It also provides a foundation for developing more richly structured statistical models of language, as the generative process assumed in the topic model can easily be extended to incorporate other kinds of semantic and syntactic structure.},

The main feature of our model is the existence of two different classes of words: (i) a finite number of core words, which have higher frequency and do not affect the probability of a new word to be used, and (ii) the remaining virtually infinite number of noncore words, which have lower frequency and, once used, reduce the probability of a new word to be used in the future. Our model relies on a careful analysis of the Google Ngram database of books published in the last centuries, and its main consequence is the generalization of Zipf’s and Heaps’ law to two-scaling regimes. We confirm that these generalizations yield the best simple description of the data among generic descriptive models and that the two free parameters depend only on the language but not on the database. From the point of view of our model, the main change on historical time scales is the composition of the specific words included in the finite list of core words, which we observe to decay exponentially in time with a rate of approximately 30 words per year for English.},

This technique has been used to the efficient exploration and querying of large and heterogeneous knowledge bases based on semantic networks in the Information and Document Retrieval domains. ONTOSPREAD implements the double process of activation and spreading of concepts in ontologies applying different restrictions of the original model like weight degradation according to the distance or others coming from the extension of this technique like the converging paths reward. This technique provide a whole framework to ease the information access, common required feature in the exploitation of the current Web of Data. Moreover, it is considered to be relevant to support the recommendation of concepts in different fields liked e-health, e-procurement or e-tourism with the objective of getting a set of ranked resources. Finally an evaluation methodology and two examples using ontologies from different domains are provided to validate the goodness, the improvement and the capabilities of this framework applied to digital libraries.},

	abstract = {"I was fortunate indeed to have worked with a fantastic team on the design and implementation of the concurrency features added to the Java platform in Java 5.0 and Java 6. Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book." --Martin Buchholz JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems "For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. Java Concurrency in Practiceprovides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today's--and tomorrow's--systems." --Doron Rajwan Research Scientist, Intel Corp "This is the book you need if you're writing--or designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating--multithreaded Java programs. If you've ever had to synchronize a method and you weren't sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover." --Ted Neward Author of Effective Enterprise Java "Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance." --Kirk Pepperdine CTO, JavaPerformanceTuning.com "This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it." --Dr. Cliff Click Senior Software Engineer, Azul Systems "I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers. Brian's book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach. This is a book I am recommending to all my readers of The Java Specialists'Newsletter, because it is interesting, useful, and relevant to the problems facing Java developers today." --Dr. Heinz Kabutz The Java Specialists'Newsletter "I've focused a career on simplifying simple problems, but this book ambitiously and effectively works to simplify a complex but critical subject: concurrency. Java Concurrency in Practiceis revolutionary in its approach, smooth and easy in style, and timely in its delivery--it's destined to be a very important book." --Bruce Tate Author of Beyond Java " Java Concurrency in Practiceis an invaluable compilation of threading know-how for Java developers. I found reading this book intellectually exciting, in part because it is an excellent introduction to Java's concurrency API, but mostly because it captures in a thorough and accessible way expert knowledge on threading not easily found elsewhere." --Bill Venners Author of Inside the Java Virtual Machine Threads are a fundamental part of the Java platform. As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In Java Concurrency in Practice, the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them. However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. Java Concurrency in Practicearms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications. Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant. This book covers: Basic concepts of concurrency and thread safety Techniques for building and composing thread-safe classes Using the concurrency building blocks in java.util.concurrent Performance optimization dos and don'ts Testing concurrent programs Advanced topics such as atomic variables, nonblocking algorithms, and the Java Memory Model},

	abstract = {Apocalyptic AI, the hope that we might one day upload our minds into machines or cyberspace and live forever, is a surprisingly wide-spread and influential idea, affecting everything from the world view of online gamers to government research funding and philosophical thought. In Apocalyptic AI, Robert Geraci offers the first serious account of this "cyber-theology" and the people who promote it. Drawing on interviews with roboticists and AI researchers and with devotees of the online game Second Life, among others, Geraci illuminates the ideas of such advocates of Apocalyptic AI as Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil. He reveals that the rhetoric of Apocalyptic AI is strikingly similar to that of the apocalyptic traditions of Judaism and Christianity. In both systems, the believer is trapped in a dualistic universe and expects a resolution in which he or she will be translated to a transcendent new world and live forever in a glorified new body. Equally important, Geraci shows how this worldview shapes our culture. For instance, Apocalyptic AI has influenced funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation, helping to prioritize robotics and AI research. It has become the ideology of choice for online gamers, such as those involved in Second Life; it has had a profound impact on the study of the mind; and it has inspired scientists and theologians alike to wonder about the super robots of the future. Should we think of robots as persons? What kind of morality would intelligent robots espouse? Apocalyptic AI has become a powerful force in modern culture. In this superb volume, Robert Geraci shines a light on this belief system, revealing what it is and how it is changing society.},

Dennett has engaged questions about science and the workings of the mind. His answers have combined rigorous argument with strong empirical grounding. And a lot of fun. Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking offers seventy-seven of Dennett’s most successful "imagination-extenders and focus-holders" meant to guide you through some of life’s most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will. With patience and wit, Dennett deftly deploys his thinking tools to gain traction on these thorny issues while offering readers insight into how and why each tool was built. Alongside well-known favorites like Occam’s Razor and reductio ad absurdum lie thrilling descriptions of Dennett’s own creations: Trapped in the Robot Control Room, Beware of the Prime Mammal, and The Wandering Two-Bitser. Ranging across disciplines as diverse as psychology, biology, computer science, and physics, Dennett’s tools embrace in equal measure light-heartedness and accessibility as they welcome uninitiated and seasoned readers alike. As always, his goal remains to teach you how to "think reliably and even gracefully about really hard questions." A sweeping work of intellectual seriousness that’s also studded with impish delights, Intuition Pumps offers intrepid thinkers—in all walks of life—delicious opportunities to explore their pet ideas with new powers.},

The central concept of the philosophy presented is the concept of "pattern": minds and the world they live in and co-create are viewed as patterned systems of patterns, evolving over time, and various aspects of subjective experience and individual and social intelligence are analyzed in detail in this light. Many of the ideas presented are motivated by recent research in artificial intelligence and cognitive science, and the author's own AI research is discussed in moderate detail in one chapter. However, the scope of the book is broader than this, incorporating insights from sources as diverse as Vedantic philosophy, psychedelic psychotherapy, Nietzschean and Peircean metaphysics and quantum theory. One of the unique aspects of the patternist approach is the way it seamlessly fuses the mechanistic, engineering-oriented approach to intelligence and the introspective, experiential approach to intelligence.},

Jung said that dreaming goes on continuously but you can't see it when you are awake, just as you can't see the stars in the daylight because it is too bright.

	abstract = {Organic Computing has emerged as a challenging vision for future information processing systems. Its basis is the insight that we will increasingly be surrounded by and depend on large collections of autonomous systems, which are equipped with sensors and actuators, aware of their environment, communicating freely, and organising themselves in order to perform actions and services required by the users. These networks of intelligent systems surrounding us open fascinating ap-plication areas and at the same time bear the problem of their controllability. Hence, we have to construct such systems as robust, safe, flexible, and trustworthy as possible. In particular, a strong orientation towards human needs as opposed to a pure implementation of the tech-nologically possible seems absolutely central. The technical systems, which can achieve these goals will have to exhibit life-like or 'organic' properties. 'Organic Computing Systems' adapt dynamically to their current environmental conditions. In order to cope with unexpected or undesired events they are self-organising, self-configuring, self-optimising, self-healing, self-protecting, self-explaining, and context-aware, while offering complementary interfaces for higher-level directives with respect to the desired behaviour. First steps towards adaptive and self-organising computer systems are being undertaken. Adaptivity, reconfigurability, emergence of new properties, and self-organisation are hot top-ics in a variety of research groups worldwide. This book summarises the results of a 6-year priority research program (SPP) of the German Research Foundation (DFG) addressing these fundamental challenges in the design of Organic Computing systems. It presents and discusses the theoretical foundations of Organic Computing, basic methods and tools, learningtechniques used in this context, architectural patterns and many applications. The final outlook shows that in the mean-time Organic Computing ideas have spawned a variety of promising new projects.},

	title = {How the brain might work: a hierarchical and temporal model for learning and recognition},
	shorttitle = {How the brain might work},
	abstract = {The brains of mammals are very efficient learning machines. Many aspects of mammalian learning are yet to be incorporated into machine learning algorithms. For instance, vision is typically considered to be a spatial problem in which a learning system needs to be trained with labeled examples of object images. Yet, mammals learn with continuously flowing unlabeled data. It is also generally accepted that the visual cortex in mammals is organized as a hierarchy and that many aspects of visual perception can be modeled using Bayesian computations. This dissertation introduces algorithms and networks that combine hierarchical and temporal learning with Bayesian inference for pattern recognition. These algorithms and networks, collectively called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), can be used to learn hierarchical-temporal models of data. Temporal continuity is used to learn multiple levels of the hierarchy without supervision. The HTM algorithms, when applied to a visual pattern recognition problem, exhibit invariant recognition, robustness to noise, and generalization. Inference in the hierarchy is performed using Bayesian belief propagation equations that are adapted to this problem setting. In order to understand the generalization properties of HTMs, a generative model for HTMs is developed. This model enables the generation of synthetic data from HTM networks. These data are used to analyze and characterize learning and generalization in hierarchical-temporal systems. Two existing hierarchical pattern recognition models are mapped to HTMs to explain the source of generalization in those models. Finally, the HTM Bayesian belief propagation equations are used to suggest a mathematical model for cortical microcircuits. The microcircuit model is derived by combining known anatomical constraints with the computational specifications of HTM belief propagation. The proposed model has a laminar and columnar organization that matches many known anatomical features. The proposed circuits are then used in the modeling of two well known physiological phenomena.},

	abstract = {The extended mind hypothesis has stimulated much interest in cognitive science. However, its core claim, i.e. that the process of cognition can extend beyond the brain via the body and into the environment, has been heavily criticized. A prominent critique of this claim holds that when some part of the world is coupled to a cognitive system this does not necessarily entail that the part is also constitutive of that cognitive system. This critique is known as the "coupling-constitution fallacy". In this paper we respond to this reductionist challenge by using an evolutionary robotics approach to create a minimal model of two acoustically coupled agents. We demonstrate how the interaction process as a whole has properties that cannot be reduced to the contributions of the isolated agents. We also show that the neural dynamics of the coupled agents has formal properties that are inherently impossible for those neural networks in isolation. By keeping the complexity of the model to an absolute minimum, we are able to illustrate how the coupling-constitution fallacy is in fact based on an inadequate understanding of the constitutive role of nonlinear interactions in dynamical systems theory.},

Fodor argues compellingly for an atomistic theory of concepts, deals out witty and pugnacious demolitions of rival theories, and suggests that future work on human cognition should build upon new foundations. This lively, conversational, and superbly accessible book is the first volume in the Oxford Cognitive Science Series, where the best original work in this field will be presented to a broad readership.

Dennett's now-classic book blends philosophy, psychology and neuroscience - with the aid of numerous examples and thought-experiments - to explore how consciousness has evolved, and how a modern understanding of the human mind is radically different from conventional explanations of consciousness. What people think of as the stream of consciousness is not a single, unified sequence, the author argues, but 'multiple drafts' of reality composed by a computer-like 'virtual machine'. Dennett explains how science has exploded the classic mysteries of consciousness: the nature of introspection, the self or ego and its relation to thoughts and sensations, the problems posed by qualia, and the level of consciousness of non-human creatures.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that astrocytes, a major population of glial cells in the brain, play previously unrecognized functions in neuronal modulation.

For example, recent findings show that astrocytes play crucial roles in the control of Hebbian plasticity, the regulation of neuronal excitability and the induction of homeostatic plasticity. This review discusses the importance of astrocyte-to-neuron signaling in different aspects of neuronal function from the activity of single synapses to that of neuronal networks.},

An EMDP keeps perception and action embedded within sensorimotor schemes rather than dissociated, in compliance with theories of embodied cognition. Rather than seeking a goal associated with a reward, as in reinforcement learning, an EMDP agent learns to master the sensorimotor contingencies offered by its coupling with the environment. In doing so, the agent exhibits a form of intrinsic motivation related to the autotelic principle (Steels, 2004), and a value system attached to interactions called interactional motivation. This modeling approach allows the design of agents capable of autonomous self-programming, which provides rudimentary constitutive autonomy—a property that theoreticians of enaction consider necessary for autonomous sense-making (e.g., Froese \&amp; Ziemke, 2009). A cognitive architecture is presented that allows the agent to discover, memorize, and exploit spatio-sequential regularities of interaction, called Enactive Cognitive Architecture (ECA). In our experiments, behavioral analysis shows that ECA agents develop active perception and begin to construct their own ontological perspective on the environment.},

In this paper I am presenting a brief outline of an alternative theory of knowing that takes into account the thinking organism's cognitive isolation from ‘reality’. This orientation was proposed by Vico at the beginning of the 18th century, disregarded for two hundred years, and then propounded independently by Piaget as a developmentally grounded constructivist epistemology. The paper focuses specifically on the adaptive function of cognition, Piaget's scheme theory, the process of communication, and the subjective perspective on social interaction. In the concluding section it then suggests some of the consequences the shift of epistemological presuppositions might have for the practice of teaching.},

Instead of seeking a goal associated with a reward, as in reinforcement learning, an EMDP agent is driven by two forms of self-motivation: successfully enacting sequences of interactions (autotelic motivation), and preferably enacting interactions that have predefined positive values (interactional motivation). An EMDP learning algorithm is presented. Results show that the agent develops a rudimentary form of self-programming, along with active perception as it learns to master the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by its coupling with the environment.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT This article addresses issues in developing cognitive architectures—generic computational models of cognition. Cognitive architectures are believed to be essential in advancing understanding of the mind, and therefore, developing cognitive architectures is an extremely important enterprise in cognitive science. The article proposes a set of essential desiderata for developing cognitive architectures. It then moves on to discuss in detail some of these desiderata and their associated concepts and ideas relevant to developing better cognitive architectures. It argues for the importance of taking into full consideration these desiderata in developing future architectures that are more cognitively and ecologically realistic. A brief and preliminary evaluation of existing cognitive architectures is attempted on the basis of these ideas. 1.},

	abstract = {There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the “symbol grounding problem”: How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) iconic representations, which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) categorical representations, which are learned and innate feature detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) symbolic representations, grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g. “An X is a Y that is Z”).

Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic “module,” however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically “dedicated” symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded.},

An interactionally motivated agent selects behaviors for the sake of enacting the behavior itself rather than for the value of the behavior's outcome. IM contrasts with extrinsic motivation by the fact that it defines the agent's motivation independently from the environment's state. Because IM does not refer to the environment's states, we argue that IM is a form of self-motivation on the same level as intrinsic motivation. IM, however, differs from intrinsic motivation by the fact that IM allows specifying the agent's inborn value system explicitly. This paper introduces a formal definition of the IM paradigm and compares it to the reinforcement-learning paradigm as traditionally implemented in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).},

The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual "filling in," visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.},

Not everyone will agree on a single set of mechanisms that will explain the full range of human cognition, but such theories are within reach and we should strive to articulate them.In this book, Newell makes the case for unified theories by setting forth a candidate. After reviewing the foundational concepts of cognitive science--knowledge, representation, computation, symbols, architecture, intelligence, and search--Newell introduces Soar, an architecture for general cognition. A pioneer system in artificial intelligence, Soar is the first problem solver to create its own subgoals and learn continuously from its own experience.Newell shows how Soar's ability to operate within the real-time constraints of intelligent behavior, such as immediate-response and item-recognition tasks, illustrates important characteristics of the human cognitive structure. Throughout, Soar remains an exemplar: we know only enough to work toward a fully developed theory of cognition, but Soar's success so far establishes the viability of the enterprise.Given its integrative approach, Unified Theories of Cognition will be of tremendous interest to researchers in a variety of fields, including cognitive science, artificial intelligence, psychology, and computer science. This exploration of the nature of mind, one of the great problems of philosophy, should also transcend disciplines and attract a large scientific audience.},

	abstract = {The cut-and-paste approach to writing statistical reports is not only tedious and laborious, but also can be harmful to scientific research, because it is inconvenient to reproduce the results. Dynamic Documents with R and knitr introduces a new approach via dynamic documents, i.e. integrating computing directly with reporting. A comprehensive guide to the R package knitr, the book covers examples, document editors, basic usage, detailed explanations of a wide range of options, tricks and solutions, extensions, and complete applications of this package. The book provides an overview of dynamic documents, introducing the idea of literate programming. It then explains the importance of dynamic documents to scientific research and its impact on reproducible research. Building on this, the author covers basic concepts, common text editors that support knitr, and the syntax for different document formats such as LaTeX, HTML, and Markdown before going on to discuss core functionality, how to control text and graphics output, caching mechanisms that can reduce computation time, and reuse of source code. He then explores advanced topics such as chunk hooks, integrating other languages such as Python and awk into one report in the knitr framework, and useful tricks that make it easier to write documents with knitr. Discussions of how to publish reports in a variety of formats, applications, and other tools complete the coverage. Suitable for both beginners and advanced users, this book shows you how to write reports in simple languages such as Markdown. The reports range from homework, projects, exams, books, blogs, and web pages to any documents related to statistical graphics, computing, and data analysis. While familiarity with LaTeX and HTML is helpful, the book requires no prior experience with advanced programs or languages. For beginners, the text provides enough features to get started on basic applications. For power users, the last several chapters enable an understanding of the extensibility of the knitr package.},

It discusses brain molecules and their primary function, which is to help carry brain signals to and from the different parts of the human body. These molecules are also essential for understanding language, learning, perception, thinking, and other cognitive functions of our brain. The book also presents the tools that can be used to view the human brain through brain imaging or recording. Brain recording is used to measure electric and magnetic signals in our brain. The most precise recording method is the single neuron or unit recording that uses deep needle electrodes implanted in the brain. In addition, the book discusses peoples consciousness and attention spans, which are considered complementary processes. Learning and memory capacity of the brain are also discussed. The study of cognitive neuroscience is very challenging, as every aspect of the human brain must be studied to fully understand how the brain works.New edition of a very successful textbookCompletely revised to reflect new advances, and feedback from adopters and studentsIncludes a new chapter on Genes and Molecules of CognitionStudent Solutions available at http://www.baars-gage.com/ For Teachers:  Rapid adoption and course preparation: A wide array of instructor support materials are available online including PowerPoint lecture slides, a test bank with answers, and eFlashcords on key concepts for each chapter.

	title = {Distributed {Algorithms} for {Message}-{Passing} {Systems}},
	isbn = {978-3-642-38123-2},
	abstract = {Distributed computing is at the heart of many applications. It arises as soon as one has to solve a problem in terms of entities -- such as processes, peers, processors, nodes, or agents -- that individually have only a partial knowledge of the many input parameters associated with the problem. In particular each entity cooperating towards the common goal cannot have an instantaneous knowledge of the current state of the other entities. Whereas parallel computing is mainly concerned with \&\#39;efficiency\&\#39;, and real-time computing is mainly concerned with \&\#39;on-time computing\&\#39;, distributed computing is mainly concerned with \&\#39;mastering uncertainty\&\#39; created by issues such as the multiplicity of control flows, asynchronous communication, unstable behaviors, mobility, and dynamicity.  While some distributed algorithms consist of a few lines only, their behavior can be difficult to understand and their properties hard to state and prove. The aim of this book is to present in a comprehensive way the basic notions, concepts, and algorithms of distributed computing when the distributed entities cooperate by sending and receiving messages on top of an asynchronous network. The book is composed of seventeen chapters structured into six parts: distributed graph algorithms, in particular what makes them different from sequential or parallel algorithms; logical time and global states, the core of the book; mutual exclusion and resource allocation; high-level communication abstractions; distributed detection of properties; and distributed shared memory. The author establishes clear objectives per chapter and the content is supported throughout with illustrative examples, summaries, exercises, and annotated bibliographies. This book constitutes an introduction to distributed computing and is suitable for advanced undergraduate students or graduate students in computer science and computer engineering, graduate students in mathematics interested in distributed computing, and practitioners and engineers involved in the design and implementation of distributed applications. The reader should have a basic knowledge of algorithms and operating systems.},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

	abstract = {The embodied and situated approach to artificial intelligence (AI) has matured and become a viable alternative to traditional computationalist approaches with respect to the practical goal of building artificial agents, which can behave in a robust and flexible manner under changing real-world conditions. Nevertheless, some concerns have recently been raised with regard to the sufficiency of current embodied AI for advancing our scientific understanding of intentional agency. While from an engineering or computer science perspective this limitation might not be relevant, it is of course highly relevant for AI researchers striving to build accurate models of natural cognition. We argue that the biological foundations of enactive cognitive science can provide the conceptual tools that are needed to diagnose more clearly the shortcomings of current embodied AI. In particular, taking an enactive perspective points to the need for AI to take seriously the organismic roots of autonomous agency and sense-making. We identify two necessary systemic requirements, namely constitutive autonomy and adaptivity, which lead us to introduce two design principles of enactive AI. It is argued that the development of such enactive AI poses a significant challenge to current methodologies. However, it also provides a promising way of eventually overcoming the current limitations of embodied AI, especially in terms of providing fuller models of natural embodied cognition. Finally, some practical implications and examples of the two design principles of enactive AI are also discussed.},

The framework of this approach is centered on a core set of ideas, such as autonomy, sense-making, emergence, embodiment, and experience. These concepts are finding novel applications in a diverse range of areas. One hot topic has been the establishment of an enactive approach to social interaction. The main purpose of this paper is to serve as an advanced entry point into these recent developments. It accomplishes this task in a twofold manner: (i) it provides a succinct synthesis of the most important core ideas and arguments in the theoretical framework of the enactive approach, and (ii) it uses this synthesis to refine the current enactive approach to social interaction. A new operational definition of social interaction is proposed which not only emphasizes the cognitive agency of the individuals and the irreducibility of the interaction process itself, but also the need for jointly co-regulated action. It is suggested that this revised conception of ‘socio-cognitive interaction’ may provide the necessary middle ground from which to understand the confluence of biological and cultural values in personal action.},

Because of its reliance on concepts such as autopoiesis, the enactive approach has been deemed internalist and thus incompatible with the extended mind hypothesis. This paper answers this criticism by showing (1) that the relation between organism and cogniser is not one of co-extension, (2) that cognition is a relational phenomenon and thereby has no location, and (3) that the individuality of a cogniser is inevitably linked with the question of its autonomy, a question ignored by the extended mind hypothesis but for which the enactive approach proposes a precise, operational, albeit non-functionalist answer. The paper raises a pespective of embedded and intersecting forms of autonomous identity generation, some of which correspond to the canonical cases discussed in the extended mind literature, but on the whole of wider generality. In addressing these issues, this paper proposes unbiased, non-species specific definitions of cognition, agency and mediation, thus filling in gaps in the extended mind debates that have led to paradoxical situations and a problematic over-reliance on intutions about what counts as cognitive.},

Generalizing, I suggest that behavioral complexity is caused partly by the diversity and intensity of neuromodulation and hence depends on emotional contexts.

	url = {http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/3365},
	abstract = {Literature on the modeling and simulation of complex adaptive systems (cas) has primarily advanced vertically in different scientific domains with scientists developing a 
variety of domain-specific approaches and applications. However, while cas researchers 
are inherently interested in an interdisciplinary comparison of models, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no single unified framework for facilitating the development, comparison, communication and validation of models across different scientific domains. 
In this thesis, we propose first steps towards such a unified framework using a combination of agent-based and complex network-based modeling approaches and guidelines formulated in the form of a set of four levels of usage, which allow multidisciplinary researchers 
to adopt a suitable framework level on the basis of available data types, their research 
study objectives and expected outcomes, thus allowing them to better plan and conduct 
their respective research case studies.  
Firstly, the complex network modeling level of the proposed framework entails the development of appropriate complex network models for the case where interaction data of 
cas components is available, with the aim of detecting emergent patterns in the cas under 
study. The exploratory agent-based modeling level of the proposed framework allows for 
the development of proof-of-concept models for the cas system, primarily for purposes of 
exploring feasibility of further research. Descriptive agent-based modeling level of the 
proposed framework allows for the use of a formal step-by-step approach for developing 
agent-based models coupled with a quantitative complex network and pseudocode-based specification of the model, which will, in turn, facilitate interdisciplinary cas model comparison and knowledge transfer. Finally, the validated agent-based modeling level of the proposed framework is concerned with the building of in-simulation verification and validation of agent-based models using a proposed Virtual Overlay Multiagent System approach for use in a systematic team-oriented approach to developing models. The proposed framework is evaluated and validated using seven detailed case study examples selected from various scientific domains including ecology, social sciences and a range of complex adaptive communication networks. The successful case studies demonstrate the potential of the framework in appealing to multidisciplinary researchers as a methodological approach to the modeling and simulation of cas by facilitating effective communication and knowledge transfer across scientific disciplines without the requirement of extensive learning curves.},

	abstract = {From one of the most significant neuroscientists at work today, a pathbreaking investigation of a question that has confounded philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists for centuries: how is consciousness created?  Antonio Damasio has spent the past thirty years studying and writing about how the brain operates, and his work has garnered acclaim for its singular melding of the scientific and the humanistic. In Self Comes to Mind, he goes against the long-standing idea that consciousness is somehow separate from the body, presenting compelling new scientific evidence that consciousness—what we think of as a mind with a self—is to begin with a biological process created by a living organism. Besides the three traditional perspectives used to study the mind (the introspective, the behavioral, and the neurological), Damasio introduces an evolutionary perspective that entails a radical change in the way the history of conscious minds is viewed and told. He also advances a radical hypothesis regarding the origins and varieties of feelings, which is central to his framework for the biological construction of consciousness: feelings are grounded in a near fusion of body and brain networks, and first emerge from the historically old and humble brain stem rather than from the modern cerebral cortex.  Damasio suggests that the brain’s development of a human self becomes a challenge to nature’s indifference and opens the way for the appearance of culture, a radical break in the course of evolution and the source of a new level of life regulation—sociocultural homeostasis. He leaves no doubt that the blueprint for the work-in-progress he calls sociocultural homeostasis is the genetically well-established basic homeostasis, the curator of value that has been present in simple life-forms for billions of years. Self Comes to Mind is a groundbreaking journey into the neurobiological foundations of mind and self.From the Hardcover edition.},

Predictions generated by the model for a free choice between undesirable alternatives were confirmed in a new psychological experiment. The success of the consonance model underscores important, unforeseen similarities between what had been formerly regarded as the rather exotic process of dissonance reduction and a variety of other, more mundane psychological processes.

The book will be an outstanding resource for readers familiar with dissonance research and an enlightening introduction for those who are not'  - Professor Russell H. Fazio, Ohio State University  Why is it that people who smoke continue to do so knowing how bad it is for them? What drives people to committing adultery even though they inherently believe this is wrong? What's the outcome of this contradiction in the mind?   Cognitive dissonance has been an important and influential theory since Leon Festinger published his classic work in 1957. It is known by every social psychologist, most psychologists of any stripe, and the lay public, making its way into such mainstream publications as The New York Times with increasing frequency and accuracy. Ultimately, dissonance has become one of the most popularly known expressions of social psychological insights, making its way into the literature in consumer, health and economic behavior, and has become a frequently used explanation of political behavior in the popular press and magazines.   In marking the 50th anniversary of the theory's inception, Joel Cooper - arguably the scholar most associated with dissonance research in the past few decades - has presented a beautiful, modern and comprehensive analysis of the state of dissonance theory. This book charts the progress of dissonance theory, assessing its impact not only within our understanding of psychology but in everyday experiences as well. It should be important reading for students in social psychology, either undergraduate or graduate, but equally relevant to a host of other readers who need to understand or share the same passions for appreciating the significance of cognitive dissonance in the human psyche.},

To galvanize this interactive turn, we provide an operational definition of social interaction and distinguish the different explanatory roles - contextual, enabling and constitutive - it can play in social cognition. We show that interactive processes are more than a context for social cognition: they can complement and even replace individual mechanisms. This new explanatory power of social interaction can push the field forward by expanding the possibilities of scientific explanation beyond the individual.},

	abstract = {Enactive approaches foreground the role of interpersonal interaction in explanations of social understanding. This motivates, in combination with a recent interest in neuroscientific studies involving actual interactions, the question of how interactive processes relate to neural mechanisms involved in social understanding. We introduce the Interactive Brain Hypothesis (IBH) in order to help map the spectrum of possible relations between social interaction and neural processes. The hypothesis states that interactive experience and skills play enabling roles in both the development and current function of social brain mechanisms, even in cases where social understanding happens in the absence of immediate interaction. We examine the plausibility of this hypothesis against developmental and neurobiological evidence and contrast it with the widespread assumption that mindreading is crucial to all social cognition. We describe the elements of social interaction that bear most directly on this hypothesis and discuss the empirical possibilities open to social neuroscience. We propose that the link between coordination dynamics and social understanding can be best grasped by studying transitions between states of coordination. These transitions form part of the self-organization of interaction processes that characterize the dynamics of social engagement. The patterns and synergies of this self-organization help explain how individuals understand each other. Various possibilities for role-taking emerge during interaction, determining a spectrum of participation. This view contrasts sharply with the observational stance that has guided research in social neuroscience until recently. We also introduce the concept of readiness to interact to describe the practices and dispositions that are summoned in situations of social significance (even if not interactive). This latter idea links interactive factors to more classical observational scenarios.},

The complete system, Darwin IV, is the latest in a series of models based on the theory of neuronal group selection, which postulates that adaptive behavior is the result of selection in somatic time among synaptic populations. The simulated brain of Darwin IV includes visual and motor areas that are connected with NOMAD by telemetry. Under suitable conditions, Darwin IV can be trained to track a light moving in a random path. After such training, it can approach colored blocks and collect them to a home position. Following a series of contacts with such blocks, value signals received through a "snout" that senses conductivity allow it to sort these blocks on the basis of differences in color associated with differences in their conductivity. Darwin IV represents a new approach to synthetic neural modeling (SNM), a technique in which large-scale computer simulations are employed to analyze the interactions among the nervous system, the phenotype, and the environment of a designed organism as behavior develops. Darwin IV retains the advantages of SNM while avoiding the difficulties and pitfalls of attempting to simulate a rich environment in addition to a brain.},

Bath application of the sodium channel blocker TTX decreased large (\&gt;5 mV) EPSPs and also blocked amplification of EPSPs at depolarized membrane potentials, whereas calcium channel blockers had little effect. Local application of TTX to the soma and axon blocked EPSP amplification, whereas dendritic application had little effect. Simultaneous somatic and axonal recordings demonstrated that EPSP amplification was largest in the axon.

	abstract = {In brains of higher vertebrates, the functional segregation of local areas that differ in their anatomy and physiology contrasts sharply with their global integration during perception and behavior. In this paper, we introduce a measure, called neural complexity (CN), that captures the interplay between these two fundamental aspects of brain organization. We express functional segregation within a neural system in terms of the relative statistical independence of small subsets of the system and functional integration in terms of significant deviations from independence of large subsets. CN is then obtained from estimates of the average deviation from statistical independence for subsets of increasing size. CN is shown to be high when functional segregation coexists with integration and to be low when the components of a system are either completely independent (segregated) or completely dependent (integrated). We apply this complexity measure in computer simulations of cortical areas to examine how some basic principles of neuroanatomical organization constrain brain dynamics. We show that the connectivity patterns of the cerebral cortex, such as a high density of connections, strong local connectivity organizing cells into neuronal groups, patchiness in the connectivity among neuronal groups, and prevalent reciprocal connections, are associated with high values of CN. The approach outlined here may prove useful in analyzing complexity in other biological domains such as gene regulation and embryogenesis.},

Edelman draws on a lifetime of scientific inquiry into the workings of the brain to formulate answers to the mind-body questions that intrigue every thinking person.Concise and understandable, the book explains pertinent findings of modern neuroscience and describes how consciousness arises in complex brains. Edelman explores the relation of consciousness to causation, to evolution, to the development of the self, and to the origins of feelings, learning, and memory. His analysis of the brain activities underlying consciousness is based on recent remarkable advances in biochemistry, immunology, medical imaging, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology, yet the implications of his book extend farther—beyond the worlds of science and medicine into virtually every area of human inquiry.},

	abstract = {The mature human brain is organized into a collection of specialized functional networks that flexibly interact to support various cognitive functions. Studies of development often attempt to identify the organizing principles that guide the maturation of these functional networks. In this report, we combine resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI), graph analysis, community detection, and spring-embedding visualization techniques to analyze four separate networks defined in earlier studies. As we have previously reported, we find, across development, a trend toward ‘segregation’ (a general decrease in correlation strength) between regions close in anatomical space and ‘integration’ (an increased correlation strength) between selected regions distant in space. The generalization of these earlier trends across multiple networks suggests that this is a general developmental principle for changes in functional connectivity that would extend to large-scale graph theoretic analyses of large-scale brain networks. Communities in children are predominantly arranged by anatomical proximity, while communities in adults predominantly reflect functional relationships, as defined from adult fMRI studies. In sum, over development, the organization of multiple functional networks shifts from a local anatomical emphasis in children to a more “distributed” architecture in young adults. We argue that this “local to distributed” developmental characterization has important implications for understanding the development of neural systems underlying cognition. Further, graph metrics (e.g., clustering coefficients and average path lengths) are similar in child and adult graphs, with both showing “small-world”-like properties, while community detection by modularity optimization reveals stable communities within the graphs that are clearly different between young children and young adults. These observations suggest that early school age children and adults both have relatively efficient systems that may solve similar information processing problems in divergent ways., The first two decades of life represent a period of extraordinary developmental change in sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities. One of the ultimate goals of developmental cognitive neuroscience is to link the complex behavioral milestones that occur throughout this time period with the equally intricate functional and structural changes of the underlying neural substrate. Achieving this goal would not only give us a deeper understanding of normal development but also a richer insight into the nature of developmental disorders. In this report, we use computational analyses, in combination with a recently developed MRI technique that measures spontaneous brain activity, to help us to understand the principles that guide the maturation of the human brain. We find that brain regions in children communicate with other regions more locally but that over age communication becomes more distributed. Interestingly, the efficiency of communication in children (measured as a ‘small world’ network) is comparable to that of the adult. We argue that these findings have important implications for understanding both the maturation and the function of neural systems in typical and atypical development.},

	abstract = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of “primary states” is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit “criticality,” i.e., the property of being poised at a “critical” point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.},

	abstract = {Although conditional branching between possible behavioral states is a hallmark of intelligent behavior, very little is known about the neuronal mechanisms that support this processing. In a step toward solving this problem, we demonstrate by theoretical analysis and simulation how networks of richly interconnected neurons, such as those observed in the superficial layers of the neocortex, can embed reliable, robust finite state machines. We show how a multistable neuronal network containing a number of states can be created very simply by coupling two recurrent networks whose synaptic weights have been configured for soft winner-take-all (sWTA) performance. These two sWTAs have simple, homogeneous, locally recurrent connectivity except for a small fraction of recurrent cross-connections between them, which are used to embed the required states. This coupling between the maps allows the network to continue to express the current state even after the input that elicited that state is withdrawn. In addition, a small number of transition neurons implement the necessary input-driven transitions between the embedded states. We provide simple rules to systematically design and construct neuronal state machines of this kind. The significance of our finding is that it offers a method whereby the cortex could construct networks supporting a broad range of sophisticated processing by applying only small specializations to the same generic neuronal circuit.},

	abstract = {We have previously derived a theoretical measure of neural complexity (CN) in an attempt to characterize functional connectivity in the brain. CN measures the amount and heterogeneity of statistical correlations within a neural system in terms of the mutual information between subsets of its units. CN was initially used to characterize the functional connectivity of a neural system isolated from the environment. In the present paper, we introduce a related statistical measure, matching complexity (CM), which reflects the change in CN that occurs after a neural system receives signals from the environment. CM measures how well the ensemble of intrinsic correlations within a neural system fits the statistical structure of the sensory input. We show that CM is low when the intrinsic connectivity of a simulated cortical area is randomly organized. Conversely, CM is high when the intrinsic connectivity is modified so as to differentially amplify those intrinsic correlations that happen to be enhanced by sensory input. When the input is represented by an individual stimulus, a positive value of CM indicates that the limited mutual information between sensory sheets sampling the stimulus and the rest of the brain triggers a large increase in the mutual information between many functionally specialized subsets within the brain. In this way, a complex brain can deal with context and go "beyond the information given."},

We now have modified and extended this model to address the problems of perceptual grouping and figure-ground segregation in vision. A novel feature is that the efficacy of the connections is allowed to change on a fast time scale. This results inactive reentrant connections that amplify the correlations among neuronal groups. The responses of the model are able to link the elements corresponding to a coherent figure and to segregate them from the background or from another figure in a way that is consistent with the so-called Gestalt laws.},

	abstract = {Many forms of learning depend on the ability of an organism to sense and react to the adaptive value of its behavior. Such value, if reflected in the activity of specific neural structures (neural value systems), can selectively increase the probability of adaptive behaviors by modulating synaptic changes in the circuits relevant to those behaviors. Neuromodulatory systems in the brain are well suited to carry out this process since they respond to evolutionarily important cues (innate value), broadcast their responses to widely distributed areas of the brain through diffuse projections, and release substances that can modulate changes in synaptic strength. The main aim of this paper is to show that, if value-dependent modulation is extended to the inputs of neural value systems themselves, initially neutral cues can acquire value. This process has important implications for the acquisition of behavioral sequences. We have used a synthetic neural model to illustrate value-dependent acquisition of a simple foveation response to a visual stimulus. We then examine the improvement that ensues when the connections to the value system are themselves plastic and thus become able to mediate acquired value. Using a second-order conditioning paradigm, we demonstrate that auditory discrimination can occur in the model in the absence of direct positive reinforcement and even in the presence of slight negative reinforcement. The discriminative responses are accompanied by value-dependent plasticity of receptive fields, as reflected in the selective augmentation of unit responses to valuable sensory cues. We then consider the time-course during learning of the responses of the value system and the transfer of these responses from one sensory modality to another. Finally, we discuss the relation of value-dependent learning to models of reinforcement learning. The results obtained from these simulations can be directly related to various reported experimental findings and provide additional support for the application of selectional principles to the analysis of brain and behavior.},

Various standardized formats and tools are now available to support practical, large-scale semantic network models. First, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) offers a standardized semantic network data model that can be further formalized by ontology modeling languages such as RDF Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the recent introduction of highly performant triple-stores (i.e. semantic network databases) allows semantic network models on the order of \$10{\textasciicircum}9\$ edges to be efficiently stored and manipulated.

	abstract = {Multi-relational networks are used extensively to structure knowledge. Perhaps the most popular instance, due to the widespread adoption of the Semantic Web, is the Resource Description Framework (RDF). One of the primary purposes of a knowledge network is to reason; that is, to alter the topology of the network according to an algorithm that uses the existing topological structure as its input. There exist many such reasoning algorithms. With respect to the Semantic Web, the bivalent, monotonic reasoners of the RDF Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) are the most prevalent. However, nothing prevents other forms of reasoning from existing in the Semantic Web. This article presents a non-bivalent, non-monotonic, evidential logic and reasoner that is an algebraic ring over a multi-relational network equipped with two binary operations that can be composed to execute various forms of inference. Given its multi-relational grounding, it is possible to use the presented evidential framework as another method for structuring knowledge and reasoning in the Semantic Web. The benefits of this framework are that it works with arbitrary, partial, and contradictory knowledge while, at the same time, it supports a tractable approximate reasoning process.},

The era was characterized by thinkers who promoted progressive social reforms that opposed the long-established aristocracies and monarchies of the time. Prominent examples of such reforms include the establishment of inalienable human rights, self-governing republics, and market capitalism. Twenty-first century democratic nations can benefit from revisiting the systems developed during the Enlightenment and reframing them within the techno-social context of the Information Age. This article explores the application of social algorithms that make use of Thomas Paine's (English: 1737--1809) representatives, Adam Smith's (Scottish: 1723--1790) self-interested actors, and Marquis de Condorcet's (French: 1743--1794) optimal decision making groups. It is posited that technology-enabled social algorithms can better realize the ideals articulated during the Enlightenment.},

In modern systems, political institutions have instatiated representative forms of decision-making to ensure that every individual in the society has a participatory voice in the decision-making behavior of the whole--even if only indirectly through representation. An agent-based simulation demonstrates that in modern representative systems, as the ratio of representatives increases, there exists an exponential decrease in the ability for the group to behave in accord with the desires of the whole. To remedy this issue, this paper provides a novel representative power structure for decision-making that utilizes a social network and power distribution algorithm to maintain the collective's perspective over varying degrees of participation and/or ratios of representation. This work shows promise for the future development of policy-making systems that are supported by the computer and network infrastructure of our society.},

	abstract = {1. Summary
In Part I, four ostensibly different theoretical models of induction are presented, in which the problem dealt with is the extrapolation of a very long sequence of symbols—presumably containing all of the information to be used in the induction. Almost all, if not all problems in induction can be put in this form.

Some strong heuristic arguments have been obtained for the equivalence of the last three models. One of these models is equivalent to a Bayes formulation, in which a priori probabilities are assigned to sequences of symbols on the basis of the lengths of inputs to a universal Turing machine that are required to produce the sequence of interest as output.

Though it seems likely, it is not certain whether the first of the four models is equivalent to the other three.

Few rigorous results are presented. Informal investigations are made of the properties of these models. There are discussions of their consistency and meaningfulness, of their degree of independence of the exact nature of the Turing machine used, and of the accuracy of their predictions in comparison to those of other induction methods.

In Part II these models are applied to the solution of three problems—prediction of the Bernoulli sequence, extrapolation of a certain kind of Markov chain, and the use of phrase structure grammars for induction.

Though some approximations are used, the first of these problems is treated most rigorously. The result is Laplace's rule of succession.

The solution to the second problem uses less certain approximations, but the properties of the solution that are discussed, are fairly independent of these approximations.

The third application, using phrase structure grammars, is least exact of the three. First a formal solution is presented. Though it appears to have certain deficiencies, it is hoped that presentation of this admittedly inadequate model will suggest acceptable improvements in it. This formal solution is then applied in an approximate way to the determination of the “optimum” phrase structure grammar for a given set of strings. The results that are obtained are plausible, but subject to the uncertainties of the approximation used.},

	abstract = {This book presents the framework for a new, comprehensive approach to                 cognitive science. The proposed paradigm, enaction, offers an alternative to                 cognitive science's classical, first-generation Computational Theory of Mind (CTM).                 Enaction, first articulated by Varela, Thompson, and Rosch in                 The Embodied Mind (MIT Press, 1991), breaks from CTM's formalisms                 of information processing and symbolic representations to view cognition as grounded                 in the sensorimotor dynamics of the interactions between a living organism and its                 environment. A living organism enacts the world it lives in; its embodied action in                 the world constitutes its perception and thereby grounds its cognition.                 Enaction offers a range of perspectives on this exciting new                 approach to embodied cognitive science.Some chapters offer                 manifestos for the enaction paradigm; others address specific areas of research,                 including artificial intelligence, developmental psychology, neuroscience, language,                 phenomenology, and culture and cognition. Three themes emerge as testimony to the                 originality and specificity of enaction as a paradigm: the relation between                 first-person lived experience and third-person natural science; the ambition to                 provide an encompassing framework applicable at levels from the cell to society; and                 the difficulties of reflexivity. Taken together, the chapters offer nothing less                 than the framework for a far-reaching renewal of cognitive                 science.Contributors: Renaud Barbaras, Didier Bottineau, Giovanna                 Colombetti, Diego Cosmelli, Hanne De Jaegher, Ezequiel A.

Not only does this result in space limitations; it also translates into unwanted delays in retrieving and processing of relevant information. There is, however, a class of two-terminal passive circuit elements with memory, memristive, memcapacitive and meminductive systems -- collectively called memelements -- that perform both information processing and storing of the initial, intermediate and final computational data on the same physical platform. Importantly, the states of these memelements adjust to input signals and provide analog capabilities unavailable in standard circuit elements, resulting in adaptive circuitry, and providing analog massively-parallel computation. All these features are tantalizingly similar to those encountered in the biological realm, thus offering new opportunities for biologically-inspired computation. Of particular importance is the fact that these memelements emerge naturally in nanoscale systems, and are therefore a consequence and a natural by-product of the continued miniaturization of electronic devices. We will discuss the various possibilities offered by memcomputing, discuss the criteria that need to be satisfied to realize this paradigm, and provide an example showing the solution of the shortest-path problem and demonstrate the healing property of the solution path.},

The exact nature of the Darwinian process has been controversial ever since, however. Godfrey-Smith draws on new developments in biology, philosophy of science, and other fields to give a new analysis and extension of Darwin's idea. The central concept used is that of a "Darwinian population," a collection of things with the capacity to undergo change by natural selection. From this starting point, new analyses of the role of genes in evolution, the application of Darwinian ideas to cultural change, and "evolutionary transitions" that produce complex organisms and societies are developed.

Many of these antireductionists, nevertheless, embrace the notion of physicalism—the idea that all biological processes are physical in nature. How, Alexander Rosenberg asks, can these self-proclaimed physicalists also be antireductionists?  With clarity and wit, Darwinian Reductionism navigates this difficult and seemingly intractable dualism with convincing analysis and timely evidence. In the spirit of the few distinguished biologists who accept reductionism—E. O. Wilson, Francis Crick, Jacques Monod, James Watson, and Richard Dawkins—Rosenberg provides a philosophically sophisticated defense of reductionism and applies it to molecular developmental biology and the theory of natural selection, ultimately proving that the physicalist must also be a reductionist.},

Piketty  shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of  knowledge have  allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic  scale predicted by  Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep  structures of capital and  inequality as much as we thought in the  optimistic decades following  World War II. The main driver of  inequality--the tendency of returns on  capital to exceed the rate of  economic growth--today threatens to  generate extreme inequalities that  stir discontent and undermine  democratic values. But economic trends  are not acts of God. Political  action has curbed dangerous inequalities  in the past, Piketty says, and  may do so again.  A work of extraordinary ambition, originality, and rigor, Capital in the Twenty-First Century reorients our understanding of economic history and confronts us with sobering lessons for today.},

Dynamical representations are analysed as distinction systems. Classical representations are characterized by the fact that all distinctions are conserved. The creation, conservation and destruction of distinctions can be understood on the basis of a distinction dynamics. The fundamental mechanism is the variation through recombination and selective retention of closed combinations. The fact that the same process may be constrained by several independent closures is emphasized. Complex dynamics is analysed as an example of a theory with a limited dynamics of distinctions: distinctions can be destroyed but not created. It is sketched how a more general theory might be applied in solving complex problems in the form of a computer program based on variation and selection .},

Billions of interconnected devices will be monitoring the environment, transportation systems, factories, farms, forests, utilities, soil and weather conditions, oceans and resources.Many of these sensors and actuators will be networked into autonomous sets, with much of the information being exchanged machine-to-machine directly and without human involvement. Machine-to-machine communications are typically terse. Most sensors and actuators will report or act upon small pieces of information - "chirps". Burdening these devices with current network protocol stacks is inefficient, unnecessary and unduly increases their cost of ownership. This must change. The architecture of theInternet of Things must evolve now byincorporating simpler protocols toward at the edges of thenetwork, or remain forever inefficient. Rethinking the Internet of Things describes reasons why we must rethink current approaches to the Internet of Things. Appropriate architectures that will coexist with existing networking protocols are described in detail. An architecture comprised of integrator functions, propagator nodes, and end devices, along with their interactions, is explored. What you’ll learnDiscusses the difference between the "normal" Internet and the Internet of Things. Describes a new architecture and its components in the "chirp" context.

It is international human rights law-not any philosophical theory of moral human rights or any "folk" conception of moral human rights-that serves as the lingua franca of modern human rights practice. Yet contemporary philosophers have had little to say about international legal human rights. They have tended to assume, rather than to argue, that international legal human rights, if morally justified, must mirror or at least help realize moral human rights. But this assumption is mistaken. International legal human rights, like many other legal rights, can be justified by several different types of moral considerations, of which the need to realize a corresponding moral right is only one. Further, this volume shows that some of the most important international legal human rights cannot be adequately justified by appeal to corresponding moral human rights. The problem is that the content of these international legal human rights-the full set of correlative duties-is much broader than can be justified by appealing to the morally important interests of any individual. In addition, it is necessary to examine the legitimacy of the institutions that create, interpret, and implement international human rights law and to defend the claim that international human rights law should "trump" the domestic law of even the most admirable constitutional democracies.},

College students are already taking cognitive enhancement drugs. The U.S. army is already working to develop drugs and technologies to produce "super soldiers." Scientists already know how to use genetic engineering techniques to enhance the strength and memories of mice and the application of such technologies to humans is on the horizon. In Better Than Human, philosopher-bioethicist Allen Buchanan grapples with the ethical dilemmas of the biomedical enhancement revolution. Biomedical enhancements can make us smarter, have better memories, be stronger, quicker, have more stamina, live much longer, avoid the frailties of aging, and enjoy richer emotional lives. In spite of the benefits that biomedical enhancements may bring, many people instinctively reject them. Some worry that we will lose something important-our appreciation for what we have or what makes human beings distinctively valuable. Others assume that biomedical enhancements will only be available to the rich, with the result that social inequalities will worsen. Buchanan shows that the debate over enhancement has been distorted by false assumptions and misleading rhetoric. To think clearly about enhancement, we have to acknowledge that human nature is a mixed bag and that our species has many "design flaws." We should be open be open to the possibility of becoming better than human, while never underestimating the risks that our attempts to improve may back-fire.},

The book offers a wide range of concepts and theorems that can be applied to politics and the economy, religion and science, art and education, organization and the family. Moreover, Luhmann’s ideas address important contemporary issues in such diverse fields as cognitive science, ecology, and the study of social movements.This book provides all the necessary resources for readers to work through the foundations of systems theory – no other work by Luhmann is as clear and accessible as this.

The first two essays deal with the modern European philosophical and scientific tradition, notably the ogy of Edmund Husserl. The next four essays concern the crucial notion of observation as defined by Luhmann. They examine the history of paradox as a logical problem and as a historically conditioned feature of rhetoric; deconstruct the thinking of Jacques Derrida, especially his language-centered allegiances; discuss the usefulness of Spencer Brown's Laws of Form; and assess the consequences of observation and paradox for epistemology.  The following essays present Luhmann's theory of communication and his articulation of the difference between thought and communication, a difference that makes clear one of Luhmann's most radical and controversial theses, that the individual not only does not form the basic element of society but is excluded from it altogether, situated instead in the environment of the social system. The book concludes with a polemic against the critical thought of the Frankfurt School of postwar German social thought.},

In this presentation of a general theory of systems, Germany's most prominent and controversial social thinker sets out a contribution to sociology that reworks our understanding of meaning and communication.  Luhmann concedes that there is no longer a binding representation of society within society, but refuses to describe this situation as a loss of legitimation or a crisis of representation. Instead, he proposes that we search for new ways of coping with the enforced selectivity that marks any self-description under the conditions of functionally differentiated modern society. For Luhmann, the end of metanarratives does not mean the end of theory, but a challenge to theory, an invitation to open itself to theoretical developments in a number of disciplines that, for quite some time, have been successfully working with cybernetic models that no longer require the fiction of the external observer.  Social Systems provides the foundation for a theory of modern society that would be congruent with this new understanding of the world. One of the most important contributions to social theory of recent decades, it has implications for many disciplines beyond sociology.},

Rhizopogon vesiculosus genets were larger, occurred at greater depths, and linked more trees than genets of R. vinicolor. Multiple tree cohorts were linked, with young saplings established within the mycorrhizal network of Douglas-fir veterans. A strong positive relationship was found between tree size and connectivity, resulting in a scale-free network architecture with small-world properties. *This mycorrhizal network architecture suggests an efficient and robust network, where large trees play a foundational role in facilitating conspecific regeneration and stabilizing the ecosystem.},

There are 20–25 million people worldwide who are blind or facing blindness due to these diseases, and they have few treatment options. Drug therapies are able to help a small fraction of the population, but for the vast majority, their best hope is through prosthetic devices [reviewed in Chader et al. (2009) Prog Brain Res 175:317–332]. Current prosthetics, however, are still very limited in the vision that they provide: for example, they allow for perception of spots of light and high-contrast edges, but not natural images. Efforts to improve prosthetic capabilities have focused largely on increasing the resolution of the device’s stimulators (either electrodes or optogenetic transducers). Here, we show that a second factor is also critical: driving the stimulators with the retina’s neural code. Using the mouse as a model system, we generated a prosthetic system that incorporates the code. This dramatically increased the system’s capabilities—well beyond what can be achieved just by increasing resolution. Furthermore, the results show, using 9,800 optogenetically stimulated ganglion cell responses, that the combined effect of using the code and high-resolution stimulation is able to bring prosthetic capabilities into the realm of normal image representation.},

	abstract = {Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason--to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter.

	abstract = {Swarmwise (2013) is a tactical guide to changing the world using cost-efficient swarm methodology. It is a leadership handbook that outlines how the Swedish Pirate Party was able to beat the competition on less than one percent of their budget, and shows how any cash- and time-strapped executive or manager can use swarm methodologies, whether the goal is social, business, or political.The organization, founded by one man without resources, has now spread to over 70 countries using the same cost-efficient swarm organization.Swarmwise will tell you what it takes to found a swarm of volunteers, how to organize and energize it, and how to lead it to success. The book doesn't go into theoretical detail, psychology, or deep research papers. Rather, it is very hands-on leadership advice from pure experience – it covers everything from how you give instructions to new marketing assistants or activists about handing out flyers in the street, up to and including how you communicate with TV stations and organize hundreds of thousands of people in a coherent swarm. Above all, it focuses on the cost-efficiency of the swarm structure, and is a tactical instruction manual for anybody who wants to dropkick their competition completely – no matter whether their game is business, social, or political.Swarmwise, chapter by chapter:Chapter 1 - Understanding the Swarm deals with the basic concepts of a swarm organization, and explains why the swarm is open and transparent. It introduces the concept of a cost-efficiency advantage of two orders of magnitude.In chapter 2 - Launching Your Swarm, we learn that the published project plan must be tangible, credible, inclusive, and epic, and what that means in practice.Chapter 3 - Getting Your Swarm Organized gives tangible advice on how to organize a volunteer organization and why. We look at the dynamics of different group sizes and how to build a culture of trust.One of the most counterintuitive lessons is detailed in Chapter 4 - Control the Vision, but Never the Message. It explains how you need to use volunteers to translate your vision into messages that fit a specific social context, rather than using an one-size-fits all slogan.A healthy dose of classic project management is found in chapter 5 - Make The Targets Visible, And Paint Them Red Daily. We talk about metrics, choosing the right metrics, and causing self-organization to happen when you publish the right metrics to optimize.In chapter 6 - Screw Democracy, We're on a Mission from God, we talk about conflict resolution mechanisms and how to optimize the swarm for speed, trust, and scalability.Chapter 7 - Surviving Growth Unlike Anything the MBAs Have Seen details how the swarm can grow by 200\% in a week when some events play out, and how to handle such situations.One of the more advanced chapters, chapter 8 - Using Social Dynamics To Their Potential goes into how we can tap into the long tail of people and effectively cross-use online and offline friendships to grow organically.Seeing how most organizations need to deal with TV, newspapers, and radio, there is also chapter 9 - Managing Oldmedia that details everything from press release processes to TV crews.Finally, chapter 10 - Beyond Success shares a bit of experience of what happens when you feel at the top of the world, and what to do then."Your most valuable asset isn't your employees," I told the executive. "Your most valuable asset are the thousands of people who want to work for you for free, and you don't let them."The book can also be downloaded as a PDF from the author's website at http://falkvinge.net/books/.},

	abstract = {From the Foreword: "In this book Joscha Bach introduces Dietrich Dorner's PSI architecture and Joscha's implementation of the MicroPSI architecture. These architectures and their implementation have several lessons for other architectures and models. Most notably, the PSI architecture includes drives and thus directly addresses questions of emotional behavior. An architecture including drives helps clarify how emotions could arise. It also changes the way that the architecture works on a fundamental level, providing an architecture more suited for behaving autonomously in a simulated world. PSI includes three types of drives, physiological (e.g., hunger), social (i.e., affiliation needs), and cognitive (i.e., reduction of uncertainty and expression of competency). These drives routinely influence goal formation and knowledge selection and application. The resulting architecture generates new kinds of behaviors, including context dependent memories, socially motivated behavior, and internally motivated task switching. This architecture illustrates how emotions and physical drives can be included in an embodied cognitive architecture. The PSI architecture, while including perceptual, motor, learning, and cognitive processing components, also includes several novel knowledge representations: temporal structures, spatial memories, and several new information processing mechanisms and behaviors, including progress through types of knowledge sources when problem solving (the Rasmussen ladder), and knowledge-based hierarchical active vision. These mechanisms and representations suggest ways for making other architectures more realistic, more accurate, and easier to use. The architecture is demonstrated in the Island simulated environment. While it may look like a simple game, it was carefully designed to allow multiple tasks to be pursued and provides ways to satisfy the multiple drives. It would be useful in its own right for developing other architectures interested in multi-tasking, long-term learning, social interaction, embodied architectures, and related aspects of behavior that arise in a complex but tractable real-time environment. The resulting models are not presented as validated cognitive models, but as theoretical explorations in the space of architectures for generating behavior. The sweep of the architecture can thus be larger-it presents a new cognitive architecture attempting to provide a unified theory of cognition. It attempts to cover perhaps the largest number of phenomena to date. This is not a typical cognitive modeling work, but one that I believe that we can learn much from." --Frank E. Ritter, Series Editor Although computational models of cognition have become very popular, these models are relatively limited in their coverage of cognition-- they usually only emphasize problem solving and reasoning, or treat perception and motivation as isolated modules. The first architecture to cover cognition more broadly is PSI theory, developed by Dietrich Dorner. By integrating motivation and emotion with perception and reasoning, and including grounded neuro-symbolic representations, PSI contributes significantly to an integrated understanding of the mind. It provides a conceptual framework that highlights the relationships between perception and memory, language and mental representation, reasoning and motivation, emotion and cognition, autonomy and social behavior. It is, however, unfortunate that PSI's origin in psychology, its methodology, and its lack of documentation have limited its impact. The proposed book adapts Psi theory to cognitive science and artificial intelligence, by elucidating both its theoretical and technical frameworks, and clarifying its contribution to how we have come to understand cognition.},

The study of cognition—cognitive science—is in essence multidisciplinary, integrating insights from approaches such as psychology, philosophy, artifical intelligence (AI), linguistics, anthropology, and neurophysiology. To this list of “sciences of the mind”, we now also must add the disciplines that study society. An increasing number of approaches are proposing that cognition is not limited to the mind of an individual agent, but involves interactions with other minds. Sociologists have long noted that most of our knowledge is the result of a social construction rather than of individual observation [Berger \& Luckman, 1967]. Philosophers such as Searle and Clark have brought the matter to research for urgent},

Chemical organization theory is a new approach that deals with such systems by describing chemical computing as a transition between organizations, which are closed and self-maintaining sets of molecular species. In this paper we show that for the case of mass-action kinetics some organizations are not feasible in the space of concentrations and thus need not to be considered in the analysis. We present a theorem providing criteria for an unfeasible organization. This is a refinement of organization theory making its statements more precise. In particular it follows for the design of a membrane computing system that the desired resulting organization of a chemical computing process should be a feasible organization. Nevertheless we show that due to the membranes in a P system unfeasible organizations can be observed, suggesting a strong link between the two approaches.},

The principle of stigmergy describes those self-organised phenomena that emerge as a consequence of indirect communication between individuals of the group through the generation of persistent cues in the environment. Interestingly, despite numerous examples of multicellular behaviours of bacteria, the principle of stigmergy has yet to become an accepted theoretical framework that describes how bacterial collectives self-organise. Here we review some examples of multicellular bacterial behaviours in the context of stigmergy with the aim of bringing this powerful and elegant self-organisation principle to the attention of the microbial research community.},

I argue that three narratives dominate the public discourse on Congo and eclipse the numerous alternative framings of the situation. These narratives focus on a primary cause of violence, illegal exploitation of mineral resources; a main consequence, sexual abuse of women and girls; and a central solution, extending state authority. I elucidate why simple narratives are necessary for policy makers, journalists, advocacy groups, and practitioners on the ground, especially those involved in the Congo. I then consider each narrative in turn and explain how they achieved prominence: they provided straightforward explanations for the violence, suggested feasible solutions to it, and resonated with foreign audiences. I demonstrate that the focus on these narratives and on the solutions they recommended has led to results that clash with their intended purposes, notably an increase in human rights violations.},

Drescher uses Piaget's                 theory as a source of inspiration for the design of an artificial cognitive system                 called the schema mechanism, and then uses the system to elaborate and test Piaget's                 theory. The approach is original enough that readers need not have extensive                 knowledge of artificial intelligence, and a chapter summarizing Piaget assists                 readers who lack a background in developmental psychology. The schema mechanism                 learns from its experiences, expressing discoveries in its existing representational                 vocabulary, and extending that vocabulary with new concepts. A novel empirical                 learning technique, marginal attribution, can find results of an action that are                 obscure because each occurs rarely in general, although reliably under certain                 conditions. Drescher shows that several early milestones in the Piagetian infant's                 invention of the concept of persistent object can be replicated by the schema                 mechanism.},

We perform stimulations on the Hopfield neural network to test this hypothesis. In our dynamical model, the neural network is allowed to learn (while awake) and unlearn (while dreaming) in alternate cycles, in much the same was as in a biological system. Our results show that with the appropriate mix of learning and unlearning (dreaming) the neural network can continue to function for ever and ever, avoiding the overloading catastrophe. As found in other palimpsest models, the dynamic storage capacity in our model is lower in comparison to the static model. This would seem to suggest that the function of dream sleep may not be primarily concerned with improving the storage capacity of the brain as is commonly thought. On the basis of this we suggest that dream sleep may be more important as a means to gradually forget weak (that is, old, irrelevant and parasitic) memories.},

My perspective on complexity, however, is a somewhat unusual one: I am interested in complex systems science principally as it reflects on abstract mathematical, computational models of mind. In my three previous books, The Structure of Intelligence, Evolving Mind, and Chaotic Logic, I have outlined a comprehensive complex-systems-theoretic theory of mind that I now call the psynet model. This book is a continuation of the research program presented in my previous books (and those books will be frequently referred to here, by the nicknames EM and CL). One might summarize the trajectory of thought spanning these four books as follows. SI formulated a philosophy and mathem- ics of mind, based on theoretical computer science and the concept of "pattern. " EM analyzed the theory of evolution by natural selection in similar terms, and used this computational theory of evolution to establish the evolutionary nature of thought.},

	abstract = {An important goal in both artificial life and biology is uncovering the most general principles underlying life, which might catalyze both our understanding of life and engineering life-like machines. While many such general principles have been hypothesized, conclusively testing them is difficult because life on Earth provides only a singular example from which to infer. To circumvent this limitation, this paper formalizes an approach called radical reimplementation. The idea is to investigate an abstract biological hypothesis by intentionally reimplementing its main principles to diverge maximally from existing natural examples. If the reimplementation successfully exhibits properties resembling biology it may better support the underlying hypothesis than an alternative example inspired more directly by nature. The approach thereby provides a principled alternative to a common tradition of defending and minimizing deviations from nature in artificial life. This work reviews examples that can be interpreted through the lens of radical reimplementation to yield potential insights into biology despite having purposefully unnatural experimental setups. In this way, radical reimplementation can help renew the relevance of computational systems for investigating biological theory and can act as a practical philosophical tool to help separate the fundamental features of terrestrial biology from the epiphenomenal.},

Success isn't defined by getting papers into print, but by getting them into the reader's consciousness. Writing Science is built upon the idea that successful science writing tells a story. It uses that insight to discuss how to write more effectively. Integrating lessons from other genres of writing with those from the author's years of experience as author, reviewer, and editor, the book shows scientists and students how to present their research in a way that is clear and that will maximize reader comprehension. The book takes an integrated approach, using the principles of story structure to discuss every aspect of successful science writing, from the overall structure of a paper or proposal to individual sections, paragraphs, sentences, and words. It begins by building core arguments, analyzing why some stories are engaging and memorable while others are quickly forgotten, and proceeds to the elements of story structure, showing how the structures scientists and researchers use in papers and proposals fit into classical models. The book targets the internal structure of a paper, explaining how to write clear and professional sections, paragraphs, and sentences in a way that is clear and compelling. The ideas within a paper should flow seamlessly, drawing readers along. The final section of the book deals with special challenges, such as how to discuss research limitations and how to write for the public. Writing Science is a much-needed guide to succeeding in modern science. Its insights and strategies will equip science students, scientists, and professionals across a wide range of scientific and technical fields with the tools needed to communicate effectively.},

abstractions with biomolecules, including logic gates, neural networks,
and linear systems. In the future such abstractions might enable nanoscale devices
that can sense and control the world at a molecular scale. Just as in macroscale
robotics, it is critical that such devices can learn about their environment and reason
under uncertainty. At this small scale, systems are typically modeled as chemical
reaction networks. In this work, we develop a procedure that can take arbitrary
probabilistic graphical models, represented as factor graphs over discrete random
variables, and compile theminto chemical reaction networks that implement inference.
In particular, we show that marginalization based on sum-product message
passing can be implemented in terms of reactions between chemical species whose
concentrations represent probabilities. We show algebraically that the steady state
concentration of these species correspond to the marginal distributions of the random
variables in the graph and validate the results in simulations. As with standard
sum-product inference, this procedure yields exact results for tree-structured
graphs, and approximate solutions for loopy graphs},

	abstract = {One goal of researchers in neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence is to build theoretical models that are able to explain the flexibility and adaptiveness of biological systems. How to build a brain provides a detailed guided exploration of a new cognitive architecture that takes biological detail seriously, while addressing cognitive phenomena.  The Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) introduced in this book provides a set of tools for constructing a wide range of biologically constrained perceptual, cognitive, and motor models. Examples of such models are provided, and they are shown to explain a wide range of data including single cell recordings, neural population activity, reaction times, error rates, choice behavior, and fMRI signals. Each of these models introduces a major feature of biological cognition addressed in the book, including semantics, syntax, control, learning, and memory. These models are not introduced as independent considerations of brain function, but instead integrated to give rise to what is currently the world's largest functional brain model. The last half of this book compares the Semantic Pointer Architecture with the current state-of-the-art, addressing issues of theory construction in the behavioral sciences, semantic compositionality, and scalability, among other considerations. The book concludes with a discussion of conceptual challenges raised by this architecture, and identifies several outstanding challenges for this, and other, cognitive architectures. Along the way, the book considers neural coding, concept representation, neural dynamics, working memory, neuroanatomy, reinforcement learning, and spike-timing dependent plasticity. The book includes 8 detailed, hands-on tutorials exploiting the free Nengo neural simulation environment, providing practical experience with the concepts and models presented throughout.},

In contrast, a multi-relational network is a network with a heterogeneous set of edge labels which can represent relationships of various types in a single data structure. While multi-relational networks are more expressive in terms of the variety of relationships they can capture, there is a need for a general framework for transferring the many single-relational network analysis algorithms to the multi-relational domain.

Many of the existing mechanisms for the automated creation of metadata rely primarily on content analysis which can be costly and inefficient. The automatic metadata generation system proposed in this article leverages resource relationships generated from existing metadata as a medium for propagation from metadata-rich to metadata-poor resources. Because of its independence from content analysis, it can be applied to a wide variety of resource media types and is shown to be computationally inexpensive. The proposed method operates through two distinct phases. Occurrence and co-occurrence algorithms first generate an associative network of repository resources leveraging existing repository metadata. Second, using the associative network as a substrate, metadata associated with metadata-rich resources is propagated to metadata-poor resources by means of a discrete-form spreading activation algorithm. This article discusses the general framework for building associative networks, an algorithm for disseminating metadata through such networks, and the results of an experiment and validation of the proposed method using a standard bibliographic dataset.},

Moreover, many of the current semantic network metrics rank semantic associations (i.e. directed paths between two vertices) and not the vertices themselves. This article presents a framework for calculating semantically meaningful primary eigenvector-based metrics such as eigenvector centrality and PageRank in semantic networks using a modified version of the random walker model of Markov chain analysis. Random walkers, in the context of this article, are constrained by a grammar, where the grammar is a user-defined data structure that determines the meaning of the final vertex ranking.

	abstract = {The basic unit of meaning on the Semantic Web is the RDF statement, or triple, which combines a distinct subject, predicate and object to make a definite assertion about the world. A set of triples constitutes a graph, to which they give a collective meaning. It is upon this simple foundation that the rich, complex knowledge structures of the Semantic Web are built. Yet the very expressiveness of RDF, by inviting comparison with real-world knowledge, highlights a fundamental shortcoming, in that RDF is limited to statements of absolute fact, independent of the context in which a statement is asserted. This is in stark contrast with the thoroughly context-sensitive nature of human thought. The model presented here provides a particularly simple means of contextualizing an RDF triple by associating it with related statements in the same graph. This approach, in combination with a notion of graph similarity, is sufficient to select only those statements from an RDF graph which are subjectively most relevant to the context of the requesting process.},

	abstract = {The idea is advanced that self-organization in complex systems can be treated as decision making (as it is performed by humans) and, vice versa, decision making is nothing but a kind of self-organization in the decision maker nervous systems. A mathematical formulation is suggested based on the definition of probabilities of system states, whose particular cases characterize the probabilities of structures, patterns, scenarios, or prospects. In this general framework, it is shown that the mathematical structures of self-organization and of decision making are identical. This makes it clear how self-organization can be seen as an endogenous decision making process and, reciprocally, decision making occurs via an endogenous self-organization. The approach is illustrated by phase transitions in large statistical systems, crossovers in small statistical systems, evolutions and revolutions in social and biological systems, structural self-organization in dynamical systems, and by the probabilistic formulation of classical and behavioral decision theories. In all these cases, self-organization is described as the process of evaluating the probabilities of macroscopic states or prospects in the search for a state with the largest probability. The general way of deriving the probability measure for classical systems is the principle of minimal information, that is, the conditional entropy maximization under given constraints. Behavioral biases of decision makers can be characterized in the same way as analogous to quantum fluctuations in natural systems.},

	abstract = {Object relations theories, both British and American, have achieved increasing prominence in recent years as the limitations of the classical psychoanalytic model have become more apparent. Despite the plethora of books written from an object relations perspective, there has to date been no textbook describing and comparing the various theories with a focus on their clinical applications. Object Relations Theories and Psychopathology: A Comprehensive Text brilliantly fills this gap in the literature.Frank Summers provides thorough, lucid, and critically informed accounts of the work of each of the major object relations theorists: Fairbairn, Guntrip, Melanie Klein, Winnicott, Kernberg, and Kohut. His expositions achieve distinction on two counts. First, the work of each object relations theorist is presented as a comprehensive whole, with separate sections of each chapter expounding the theorist's ideas and assumptions about metapsychology, development, psychopathology, and treatment. Summers concludes each account with a critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the theory in question. Second, the emphasis in each chapter is on issues of clinical understanding and technique. Making extensive use of case material provided by each of the theorists, he shows how each object relations theory yields specific clinical approaches to a variety of syndromes, and how these approaches, in turn, entail specific modifications in clinical technique.Beyond his detailed attention to the theoretical and technical differences among object relations theories, Summers offers two concluding chapters that highlight the broad commonalities that link all object relations theories and set them apart from other contemporary approaches. His penultimate chapter discusses the similarities and differences of object relations and interpersonal theories. And his concluding chapter outlines a pragmatic object relations approach to development, psychopathology, and technique that combines elements of all object relations theories without opting for any single theory.Object Relations Theories and Psychopathology is that rare event in psychoanalytic publishing: a substantive, readable text that surveys a broad expanse of the theoretical and clinical landscape with erudition, sympathy, and critical perspective. It will be essential reading for all analysts, psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers who wish to familiarize themselves with object relations theories in general, sharpen their understanding of the work of specific object relations theorists, or enhance their ability to employ these theories in their clinical work.},

The individual recurrent networks simulate the process of information uptake, integration, and memorization within individual agents, and the communication of beliefs and opinions between agents is propagated along connections between the individual networks. A crucial aspect in belief updating based on information from other agents is the trust in the information provided. In the model, trust is determined by the consistency with the receiving agents' existing beliefs and results in changes of the connections between individual networks, called trust weights. These weights lead to a selective propagation and thus to the filtering out of less reliable information, and they implement H. P. Grice's (1975) maxims of quality and quantity in communication. The unique contribution of communicative mechanisms beyond intrapersonal processing of individual networks was explored in simulations of key phenomena involving persuasive communication and polarization, lexical acquisition, spreading of stereotypes and rumors, and a lack of sharing unique information in group decisions.},

We show that a self-maintaining cell has the potential to reproduce itself spontaneously. Further, we have demonstrated two different ways of cellular reproduction depending on the mobility of chemicals. In the first case, a cell releases autocatalytic chemicals that create new cells outside the mother cell. In the second case, a cell grows larger and divides itself into daughter cells by creating a new internal dividing membrane.},

The aim of these modifications is to improve on the longevity of the agents and to implement growth. We demonstrate by means of two simulation runs that the improvements indeed have the desired effects. 1 Background: SCL A computational model of autopoiesis was originally described by Varela et al. (1974). This was re-implemented by McMullin in Swarm 1 as the SCL system (McMullin and Varela, 1997; McMullin, 1997). SCL contains three different types of particles: substrate (S), catalyst (C) and links (L). In this model an autopoietic agent or organisation consists of a closed (self-repairing) chain of doubly bonded links which encloses a C particle. In order to qualify as an interesting instance of autopoiesis, its longevity has to exceed that of its components (the links) which are designed to be unstable. In the experiments presented in (McMullin and Varela, 1997) the minimal autopoietic organisation could be sustained for up to approximately 1800 time-steps, but was eventually irreparably corrupted by some decaying links which could not be replaced quickly enough.},

This required interaction was re-discovered only following careful examination of (unpublished) source code for an early version of the original model.

	abstract = {While self-assembly is a fairly active area of research in swarm intelligence, relatively little attention has been paid to the issues surrounding the construction of network structures. In this paper we extend methods developed previously for controlling collective movements of agent teams to serve as the basis for self-assembly or “growth” of networks, using neural networks as a concrete application to evaluate our approach. Our central innovation is having network connections arise as persistent “trails” left behind moving agents, trails that are reminiscent of pheromone deposits made by agents in ant colony optimization models. The resulting network connections are thus essentially a record of agent movements. We demonstrate our model’s effectiveness by using it to produce two large networks that support subsequent learning of topographic and feature maps. Improvements produced by the incorporation of collective movements are also examined through computational experiments. These results indicate that methods for directing collective movements can be adopted to facilitate network self-assembly.},

Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself.Hawkins develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines.The brain is not a computer, but a memory system that stores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the world, remembering sequences of events and their nested relationships and making predictions based on those memories. It is this memory-prediction system that forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness.In an engaging style that will captivate audiences from the merely curious to the professional scientist, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of how the brain works will make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.Written with acclaimed science writer Sandra Blakeslee, On Intelligence promises to completely transfigure the possibilities of the technology age. It is a landmark book in its scope and clarity.},

By developing higher-level cognitive functions through the power of artificial associative neuron architectures, the author approaches the issues of machine consciousness.Robot Brains expertly outlines a complete system approach to cognitive machines, offering practical design guidelines for the creation of non-numeric autonomous creative machines. It details topics such as component parts and realization principles, so that different pieces may be implemented in hardware or software. Real-world examples for designers and researchers are provided, including circuit and systems examples that few books on this topic give.In novel technical and practical detail, this book also considers:the limitations and remedies of traditional neural associators in creating true machine cognition;basic circuit assemblies cognitive neural architectures;how motors can be interfaced with the associative neural system in order for fluent motion to be achieved without numeric computations;memorization, imagination, planning and reasoning in the machine;the concept of machine emotions for motivation and value systems;an approach towards the use and understanding of natural language in robots.The methods presented in this book have important implications for computer vision, signal processing, speech recognition and other information technology fields. Systematic and thoroughly logical, it will appeal to practising engineers involved in the development and design of robots and cognitive machines, also researchers in Artificial Intelligence. Postgraduate students in computational neuroscience and robotics, and neuromorphic engineers will find it an exciting source of information.},

	abstract = {General purpose GPU Computing (GPGPU) has taken off in the past few years, with great promises for increased desktop processing power due to the large number of fast computing cores on high-end graphics cards. Many publications have demonstrated phenomenal performance and have reported speedups as much as 1000× over code running on multi-core CPUs. Other studies have claimed that well-tuned CPU code reduces the performance gap significantly. We demonstrate that this important discussion is missing a key aspect, specifically the question of where in the system data resides, and the overhead to move the data to where it will be used, and back again if necessary. We have benchmarked a broad set of GPU kernels on a number of platforms with different GPUs and our results show that when memory transfer times are included, it can easily take between 2 to 50× longer to run a kernel than the GPU processing time alone. Therefore, it is necessary to either include memory transfer overhead when reporting GPU performance, or to explain why this is not relevant for the application in question. We suggest a taxonomy for future CPU/GPU comparisons, and we argue that this is not only germane for reporting performance, but is important to heterogeneous scheduling research in general.},

The σ profile of a system shows the satisfaction at different scales, with the possibility to study their dependencies and evolution. It can also be used to extend game theoretic models.

Several efforts have been made to deal with this complexity using the concept of self-organization. However, in order to promote its use and understanding, we must first have a pragmatic understanding of complexity and self-organization. This paper presents a conceptual framework for speaking about self-organizing systems. The aim is to provide a methodology useful for designing and controlling systems developed to solve complex problems. First, practical notions of complexity and self-organization are given. Then, starting from the agent metaphor, a conceptual framework is presented. This provides formal ways of speaking about "satisfaction" of elements and systems. The main premise of the methodology claims that reducing the "friction" or "interference" of interactions between elements of a system will result in a higher "satisfaction" of the system, i.e. better performance. The methodology discusses different ways in which this can be achieved. A case study on self-organizing traffic lights illustrates the ideas presented in the paper.},

The description of these architectures as CNs allows their comparison. Their differences and similarities allow the identification of properties that enable neural and swarm architectures to perform complex computations and exhibit complex cognitive abilities. In this context, the most relevant characteristics of CNs are the existence multiple dynamical and functional scales. The relationship between multiple dynamical and functional scales with adaptation, cognition (of brains and swarms) and computation is discussed.},

Through different experiments, I compare the performance of the models and conclude that there is no ''best'' model, since different models are better for different things in different contexts. Using the results as an empirical philosophical aid, I note that there is no ''best'' approach for studying cognition, since different paradigms have all advantages and disadvantages, since they study different aspects of cognition from different contexts. This has implications for current debates on ''proper'' approaches for cognition: all approaches are a bit proper, but none will be ''proper enough''. I draw remarks on the notion of cognition abstracting from all the approaches used to study it, and propose a simple classification for different types of cognition.},

As a result, the choice of the best model is regarded as more of an art than a science. In order to improve the model selection process, model performance needs to be clearly defined, and suitable model attributes identified that can be used to predict the performance of the alternative candidate models. This paper distinguishes the different aspects of model performance and considers the extent to which they can be measured. The most common attributes used to compare alternative models are level of detail and complexity although these terms are used in a number of different ways. The meanings of these concepts are therefore discussed and the likely relationships with the model performance elements considered. The related area of simplification is reviewed and the areas in which further work is required are set out.},

	abstract = {Complex adaptive systems consist of a large number of interacting agents. Agents are goal-directed, cognitive individuals capable of perception, information processing and action. However, agents are intrinsically “bounded” in their rational understanding of the system they belong to, and its global organization tends to emerge from local interactions, resulting in a coordination of the agents and their actions. This coordination minimizes conflict or friction, while facilitating cooperation or synergy. The basic mechanism is the reinforcement of synergetic interactions and the suppression of conflictual ones. As a result, the system as a whole starts to behave like an integrated cognitive “superagent”. The author presents several examples of this process of spontaneous coordination that leads to distributed cognition, including the emergence of a shared vocabulary, the development of standard referential expressions, the evolution of transmitted ideas (memes) towards more stereotypical forms, and the aggregation of diverse experiences into collective decisions, in which the system as a whole is more intelligent than its individual components. These phenomena have been investigated by means of multi-agent computer simulations and social psychological experiments.},

It is this last work that brought Simondon into the publiceye; as a consequence, he has been considered a "thinker of technics" and cited often inpedagogical reports on teaching technology. Yet Simondon was a philosopher whose ambitions lay in anin-depth renewal of ontology as a process of individuation--that is, how individuals come intobeing, persist, and transform. In this accessible yet rigorous introduction to Simondon's work,Muriel Combes helps to bridge the gap between Simondon's account of technics and his philosophy ofindividuation. Some thinkers have found inspiration in Simondon's philosophy of individuation,notably Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. Combes's account, first published in French in 1999, isone of the only studies of Simondon to appear in English. Combes breaks new ground, exploring anethics and politics adequate to Simondon's hypothesis of preindividual being, considering throughthe lens of transindividual philosophy what form a nonservile relation to technology might taketoday. Her book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand Simondon's work.},

	abstract = {A global workspace (GW) is a functional hub of binding and propagation in a population of loosely coupled signaling elements. In computational applications, GW architectures recruit many distributed, specialized agents to cooperate in resolving focal ambiguities. In the brain, conscious experiences may reflect a GW function. For animals, the natural world is full of unpredictable dangers and opportunities, suggesting a general adaptive pressure for brains to resolve focal ambiguities quickly and accurately. GW theory aims to understand the differences between conscious and unconscious brain events. In humans and related species the cortico-thalamic (C-T) core is believed to underlie conscious aspects of perception, thinking, learning, feelings of knowing (FOK), felt emotions, visual imagery, working memory, and executive control. Alternative theoretical perspectives are also discussed. The C-T core has many anatomical hubs, but conscious percepts are unitary and internally consistent at any given moment. Over time, conscious contents constitute a very large, open set. This suggests that a brain-based GW capacity cannot be localized in a single anatomical hub. Rather, it should be sought in a functional hub – a dynamic capacity for binding and propagation of neural signals over multiple task-related networks, a kind of neuronal cloud computing. In this view, conscious contents can arise in any region of the C-T core when multiple input streams settle on a winner-take-all equilibrium. The resulting conscious gestalt may ignite an any-to-many broadcast, lasting ∼100–200 ms, and trigger widespread adaptation in previously established networks. To account for the great range of conscious contents over time, the theory suggests an open repertoire of binding1 coalitions that can broadcast via theta/gamma or alpha/gamma phase coupling, like radio channels competing for a narrow frequency band. Conscious moments are thought to hold only 1–4 unrelated items; this small focal capacity may be the biological price to pay for global access. Visuotopic maps in cortex specialize in features like color, retinal size, motion, object identity, and egocentric/allocentric framing, so that a binding coalition for the sight of a rolling billiard ball in nearby space may resonate among activity maps of LGN, V1-V4, MT, IT, as well as the dorsal stream. Spatiotopic activity maps can bind into coherent gestalts using adaptive resonance (reentry). Single neurons can join a dominant coalition by phase tuning to regional oscillations in the 4–12 Hz range. Sensory percepts may bind and broadcast from posterior cortex, while non-sensory FOKs may involve prefrontal and frontotemporal areas. The anatomy and physiology of the hippocampal complex suggest a GW architecture as well. In the intact brain the hippocampal complex may support conscious event organization as well as episodic memory storage.},

Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target propagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce the reliance on back-propagation in order to perform credit assignment across many levels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for back-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction that is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction of higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also allow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder takes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in input, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target towards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side information. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation in a learned way that can thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but larger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long chain of non-linear operations. For this to work, each layer must be a good denoising or regularized auto-encoder itself. In addition to each layer being a good auto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by transforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them, flattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical justifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with conjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or experimentally.},

How many words (and which ones) do we need to ground directly in sensorimotor experience in order to be able to learn all other words via definition alone? The answer may shed some light both on the developmental origin of word meanings and on the evolutionary origin and adaptive value of language. We used an algorithm to reduce each of our dictionaries (Longmans LDOCE, Cambridge CIDE and WordNet) to its “grounding kernel ” (“Kernel”) (which turned out to be about 10 \% of the dictionary) by systematically eliminating all words that could be reached through definition alone [2] (illustration with a contrived toy dictionary [Table 1] in Figures 1 and 2).

In this chapter, we examine routines and capabilities as an important micro–foundation for organizational learning. Adopting a micro–foundational approach in line with Barney and Felin (2013), we propose a new model for explaining how routines and capabilities play a causal role in transforming experience into repertoires of (actual or potential) organization–level behavior. More specifically, we argue that routines and capabilities are built out of capacities for shared – both joint and collective – intentionality (Tomasello, 1999, 2014; Bratman, 1999a, 2014) that enable individuals to engage in complex forms of collaboration in conjunction with multiple layers of scaffolds that encompass material and symbolic resources, social processes, and cultural norms and practices (Weick, 1995; Hutchins, 1995; Clark, 1997, 2008; Orlikowski, 2007). In short, we outline what we call the ‘scaffolded joint action’ model and suggest its potential as a micro–foundation of organizational learning.},

A fundamental property of networks is that perturbations to one node can affect other nodes, potentially causing the entire system to change behavior or fail. Here, we show that it is possible to exploit the same principle to control network behavior. Our approach accounts for the nonlinear dynamics inherent to real systems, and allows bringing the system to a desired target state even when this state is not directly accessible due to constraints that limit the allowed interventions. Applications show that this framework permits reprogramming a network to a desired task as well as rescuing networks from the brink of failure---which we illustrate through the mitigation of cascading failures in a power-grid network and the identification of potential drug targets in a signaling network of human cancer.},

	abstract = {Because human cognition is creative and socially situated, knowledge accumulates, diffuses, and gets applied in new contexts, generating cultural analogs of phenomena observed in population genetics such as adaptation and drift. It is therefore commonly thought that elements of culture evolve through natural selection. However, natural selection was proposed to explain how change accumulates despite lack of inheritance of acquired traits, as occurs with template-mediated replication. It cannot accommodate a process with significant retention of acquired or horizontally (e.g. socially) transmitted traits. Moreover, elements of culture cannot be treated as discrete lineages because they constantly interact and influence one another. It is proposed that what evolves through culture is the mind; ideas and artifacts are merely reflections of its current evolved state. Interacting minds transform (in part) through through a non-Darwinian autopoietic process similar to that by which early life evolved, involving not survival of the fittest but actualization of their potential.},

To fill this gap, this essay introduces nine criteria to compare worldviews, classified in three broad categories: objective criteria (objective consistency, scientificity, scope), subjective criteria (subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality), and intersubjective criteria (intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity). The essay first defines what a worldview is and exposes the heuristic used in the quest for criteria. After describing each criterion individually, it shows what happens when each of them is violated. From the criteria, it derives assessment tests to compare and improve different worldviews. These include the is-ought, ought-act, and is-act first-order tests; the critical and dialectical second-order tests; the mixed-questions and first-second-order third-order tests; and the we-I, we-it, and it-I tests. The essay then applies these criteria and tests to a concrete example, comparing the Flying Spaghetti Monster deity with Intelligent Design. For another application, it draws more general fruitful suggestions for the dialogue between science and religion.},

	abstract = {Systems intended to operate in dynamic, complex environments – without intervention from their designers or significant amounts of domain-dependent information provided at design time – must be equipped with a sufficient level of existential autonomy. This feature of naturally intelligent systems has largely been missing from cognitive architectures created to date, due in part to the fact that high levels of existential autonomy require systems to program themselves; good principles for self-programming have remained elusive. Achieving this with the major programming methodologies in use today is not likely, as these are without exception designed to be used by the human mind: Producing self-programming systems that can grow from first principles using these therefore requires first solving the AI problem itself – the very problem we are trying to solve. Advances in existential autonomy call for a new programming paradigm, withself-programming squarely at its center. The principles of such a paradigm are likely to be fundamentally different from prevailing approaches; among the desired features for a programming language designed for automatic self-programming are (a) support for autonomous knowledge acquisition, (b) real-time and any-time operation, (c) reflectivity, and (d) massive parallelization. With these and other requirements guiding our work, we have created a programming paradigm and language called Replicode. Here we discuss the reasoning behind our approach and the main motivations and features that set this work from apart from prior approaches.},

Its econometric implementation interacts shocks with backward‐looking inertia. The right fork approach emphasizes forward‐looking expectations that can jump in response to anticipated policy changes.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The concept of bias and its effects on study results are reviewed.
SUMMARY: Understanding bias is paramount for the conduct of sound research studies. In the context of research methodology, bias refers to the presence of systematic error in a study. This report serves as an introduction to the concept of bias and describes three major areas through which bias is introduced into research studies of health care interventions: (1) factors that relate to the exposure of patients to treatments in the population, (2) factors that influence inclusion of patients in the study, and (3) factors related to assessment and measurement. Methods to address bias in both design and analysis stages of a study are presented, including restriction, matching, multivariate analysis, instrumental variable estimation, and the prevention of misclassification of information. While some biases are specific to certain study designs and approaches, the general concepts of how bias is introduced into a study apply equally to randomized controlled trials, prospective observational or quasiexperimental studies, and retrospective studies. An important difference between the designs is how much opportunity the investigator has to avoid bias and influence accuracy of measurements, ranging from ideally full control in randomized controlled trials to almost no control in retrospective studies of automated databases.
CONCLUSION: Investigators should aim to avoid bias in the design of a study, adjust for bias in the study analysis if bias cannot feasibly be avoided, and quantify and discuss the effects of residual bias on study results.},

	abstract = {Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998) was a German sociologist and system theorist who wrote on law, economics, politics, art, religion, ecology, mass media, and love. Luhmann advocated a radical constructivism and antihumanism, or "grand theory," to explain society within a universal theoretical framework. Nevertheless, despite being an iconoclast, Luhmann is viewed as a political conservative. Hans-Georg Moeller challenges this legacy, repositioning Luhmann as an explosive thinker critical of Western humanism.Moeller focuses on Luhmann's shift from philosophy to theory, which introduced new perspectives on the contemporary world. For centuries, the task of philosophy meant transforming contingency into necessity, in the sense that philosophy enabled an understanding of the necessity of everything that appeared contingent. Luhmann pursued the opposite--the transformation of necessity into contingency. Boldly breaking with the heritage of Western thought, Luhmann denied the central role of humans in social theory, particularly the possibility of autonomous agency. In this way, after Copernicus's cosmological, Darwin's biological, and Freud's psychological deconstructions of anthropocentrism, he added a sociological "fourth insult" to human vanity.A theoretical shift toward complex system-environment relations helped Luhmann "accidentally" solve one of Western philosophy's primary problems: mind-body dualism. By pulling communication into the mix, Luhmann rendered the Platonic dualist heritage obsolete. Moeller's clarity opens such formulations to general understanding and directly relates Luhmannian theory to contemporary social issues. He also captures for the first time a Luhmannian attitude toward society and life, defined through the cultivation of modesty, irony, and equanimity.},

It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. If machine brains surpassed human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become extremely powerful―possibly beyond our control. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on humans than on the species itself, so would the fate of humankind depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence.  But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed Artificial Intelligence, to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation?This profoundly ambitious and original audiobook breaks down a vast track of difficult intellectual terrain. After an utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.},

	abstract = {A wide range of evidence points toward the existence of a common algorithm underlying the processing of information throughout the cerebral cortex. Several hypothesized features of this cortical algorithm are reviewed, including sparse distributed representation, Bayesian inference, hierarchical organization composed of alternating template matching and pooling layers, temporal slowness and predictive coding. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a family of learning algorithms and corresponding theories of cortical function that embodies these principles. HTM has previously been applied mainly to perceptual tasks typical of posterior cortex. In order to evaluate HTM as a candidate model of cortical function, it is necessary also to investigate its compatibility with the requirements of frontal cortical function. To this end, a variety of models of frontal cortical function are reviewed and integrated, to arrive at the hypothesis that frontal functions including attention, working memory and action selection depend largely upon the same basic algorithms as do posterior functions, with the notable additions of a mechanism for the active maintenance of representations and of multiple cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops that allow communication between regions of frontal cortex to be gated in an adaptive manner. Computational models of this system are reviewed. Finally, there is a discussion of how HTM can contribute to the understanding of frontal cortical function, and of what the requirements of frontal cortical function mean for the future development of HTM.},

	abstract = {One might imagine that AI systems with harmless goals will be harmless. This paper instead shows that intelligent systems will need to be carefully designed to prevent them from behaving in harmful ways. We identify a number of “drives” that will appear in sufficiently advanced AI systems of any design. We call them drives because they are tendencies which will be present unless explicitly counteracted. We start by showing that goal-seeking systems will have drives to model their own operation and to improve themselves. We then show that self-improving systems will be driven to clarify their goals and represent them as economic utility functions. They will also strive for their actions to approximate rational economic behavior. This will lead almost all systems to protect their utility functions from modification and their utility measurement systems from corruption. We also discuss some exceptional systems which will want to modify their utility functions. We next discuss the drive toward self-protection which causes systems try to prevent themselves from being harmed. Finally we examine drives toward the acquisition of resources and toward their efficient utilization. We end with a discussion of how to incorporate these insights in designing intelligent technology which will lead to a positive future for humanity.},

The first, the orthogonality thesis, holds (with some caveats) that intelligence and final goals (purposes) are orthogonal axes along which possible artificial intellects can freely vary—more or less any level of intelligence could be combined with more or less any final goal. The second, the instrumental convergence thesis, holds that as long as they possess a sufficient level of intelligence, agents having any of a wide range of final goals will pursue similar intermediary goals because they have instrumental reasons to do so. In combination, the two theses help us understand the possible range of behavior of superintelligent agents, and they point to some potential dangers in building such an agent.},

We further argue that this capacity derives from the ‘dynamic decoupling’ (in its minimal or most basic sense: the phenotype–genotype decoupling) by means of which a radically new way of material organization (minimal living organization) is achieved, allowing for the long-term sustenance of systems whose individual-metabolic and collective-historical pathways become thereafter deeply intertwined.},

	abstract = {Stuart Kauffman here presents a brilliant new paradigm for evolutionary biology, one that extends the basic concepts of Darwinian evolution to accommodate recent findings and perspectives from the fields of biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics. The book drives to the heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance of order in complex biological systems. It focuses on the concept of self-organization: the spontaneous emergence of order widely observed throughout nature. Kauffman here argues that self-organization plays an important role in the emergence of life itself and may play as fundamental a role in shaping life's subsequent evolution as does the Darwinian process of natural selection. Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the concept of self-organization into evolutionary theory. The construction requirements which permit complex systems to adapt remain poorly understood, as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able to adapt more successfully. This book explores these themes. It shows how complex systems, contrary to expectations, can spontaneously exhibit stunning degrees of order, and how this order, in turn, is essential for understanding the emergence and development of life on Earth. Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular evolution, with its important implications for developing new drugs and vaccines; the balance between order and chaos observed in many naturally occurring systems; new insights concerning the predictive power of statistical mechanics in biology; and other major issues. Indeed, the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new center around which biologicalscience itself will evolve. The work is written for all those interested in the cutting edge of research in the life sciences.},

The macroscopic long time dynamics is intermittent and exhibits a slow decrease in the macroscopic extinction rate. Ecological quantities such as the species abundance distribution and the species-area relationship compare qualitatively well with observations, as does the relation between interaction and diversity. The effect of correlations between parents and mutants has been studied, as has the effect of a conserved resource.},

Evolution produces two distinct types of network. When a specific genotype is only able to influence a few other genotypes, the ecosystem consists of separate non-interacting clusters (i.e. isolated compartments) in genotype space. When different types may influence a large number of other sites, the network becomes one large interconnected cluster. The distribution of interaction strengths—but not the number of connections—changes significantly with time. We find that the species abundance is only realistic for a high level of species connectivity. This suggests that real ecosystems form one interconnected whole in which selection leads to stronger interactions between the different types. Analogies with niche and neutral theory and assembly models are also considered.},

A world that is as creative and complex as it is dangerous and disturbing. A world that is much closer than you think.  The dark net is an underworld that stretches from popular social media sites to the most secretive corners of the encrypted web. It is a world that frequently appears in newspaper headlines, but one that is little understood, and rarely explored. The Dark Net is a revelatory examination of the internet today, and of its most innovative and dangerous subcultures: trolls and pornographers, drug dealers and hackers, political extremists and computer scientists, Bitcoin programmers and self-harmers, libertarians and vigilantes.

As a consequence, Hegel’s absolute idealism has become the bogeyman of philosophy, obscuring the fact that he is the defining philosopher of the historical transition to modernity, a period with which our own times share startling similarities. Today, as global capitalism comes apart at the seams, we are entering a new period of transition. In Less Than Nothing, the product of a career-long focus on the part of its author, Slavoj Žižek argues it is imperative we not simply return to Hegel but that we repeat and exceed his triumphs, overcoming his limitations by being even more Hegelian than the master himself. Such an approach not only enables Žižek to diagnose our present condition, but also to engage in a critical dialogue with key strands of contemporary thought—Heidegger, Badiou, speculative realism, quantum physics, and cognitive sciences. Modernity will begin and end with Hegel.},

	doi = {10.1037/a0033180},
	abstract = {Binary choice tasks, such as 2-alternative forced choice, show a complex yet consistent pattern of sequential effects, whereby responses and response times depend on the detailed pattern of prior stimuli going back at least 5 trials. We show this pattern is well explained by simultaneous incremental learning of 2 simple statistics of the trial sequence: the base rate and the repetition rate. Both statistics are learned by the same basic associative mechanism, but they contribute different patterns of sequential effects because they entail different representations of the trial sequence. Subtler aspects of the data that are not explained by these 2 learning processes alone are explained by their interaction, via learning from joint error correction. Specifically, the cue-competition mechanism that has explained classic findings in animal learning (e.g., blocking) appears to operate on learning of sequence statistics. We also find that learning of the base rate and repetition rate are dissociated into response and stimulus processing, respectively, as indicated by event-related potentials, manipulations of stimulus discriminability, and reanalysis of past experiments that eliminated stimuli or prior responses. Thus, sequential effects in these tasks appear to be driven by learning the response base rate and the stimulus repetition rate. Connections are discussed between these findings and previous research attempting to separate stimulus- and response-based sequential effects, and research using sequential effects to determine mental representations. We conclude that sequential effects offer a powerful means for uncovering representations and learning mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The Kamasutra is the oldest extant textbook of erotic love. But it is more than a book about sex. It is about the art of living--about finding a partner, maintaining power in a marriage, committing adultery, living as or with a courtesan, using drugs--and also, of course, about the many and varied positions available to lovers in sexual intercourse and the pleasures to be derived from each.  The Kamasutra was composed in Sanskrit, the literary language of ancient India, sometime in the third century, probably in North India. It combines an encyclopedic coverage of all imaginable aspects of sex with a closely observed sexual psychology and a dramatic, novelistic narrative of seduction, consummation, and disentanglement. Best known in English through the highly mannered, padded, and inaccurate nineteenth-century translation by Sir Richard Burton, the text is newly translated here into clear, vivid, sexually frank English. This edition also includes a section of vivid Indian color illustrations along with three uniquely important commentaries: translated excerpts from the earliest and most famous Sanskrit commentary (thirteenth century) and from a twentieth-century Hindi commentary, and explanatory notes by the two translators. The lively and entertaining introduction by translator Wendy Doniger, one of the world's foremost Sanskrit scholars, discusses the history of The Kamasutra and its reception in India and Europe, analyses its attitudes toward gender and sexual violence, and sets it in the context of ancient Indian social theory, scientific method, and sexual ethics. "[This] new translation is fascinating, thought-provoking and occasionally even amusing."--Salon.comAbout the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

We propose due process as a central activity in organizational information processing. Computer systems are beginning to play important roles in mediating the ongoing activities of organizations. We expect that these roles will gradually increase in importance as computer systems take on more of the authority and responsibility for ongoing activities. At the same time we expect computer systems to acquire more of the characteristics and structure of human organizations.},

	abstract = {Abstract The paper argues that the development of distributed artificial intelligence should be based on a social metaphor, rather than a psychological one. The Turing Test should be replaced by the “Durkheim Test,” that is, systems should be tested with respect to their ability to meet community goals. Understanding community goals means analyzing the problem of due process in open systems. Due process means incorporating differing viewpoints for decision-making in a fair and flexible manner. It is the analog of the frame problem in artificial intelligence. From analyses of organizational problem solving in scientific communities, the paper derives the concept of boundary objects, and suggests that this concept would be an appropriate data structure for distributed artificial intelligence. Boundary objects are those objects that are plastic enough to be adaptable across multiple viewpoints, yet maintain continuity of identity. Four types of boundary object are identified: repositories, ideal types, terrain with coincident boundaries, and forms.},

	abstract = {The fundamental goal of perception is to aid in the achievement of behavioral objectives. This requires extracting and communicating useful information from noisy and uncertain sensory signals. At the same time, given the complexity of sensory information and the limitations of biological information processing, it is necessary that some information must be lost or discarded in the act of perception. Under these circumstances, what constitutes an ‘optimal’ perceptual system? This paper describes the mathematical framework of rate–distortion theory as the optimal solution to the problem of minimizing the costs of perceptual error subject to strong constraints on the ability to communicate or transmit information. Rate–distortion theory offers a general and principled theoretical framework for developing computational-level models of human perception (Marr, 1982). Models developed in this framework are capable of producing quantitatively precise explanations for human perceptual performance, while yielding new insights regarding the nature and goals of perception. This paper demonstrates the application of rate–distortion theory to two benchmark domains where capacity limits are especially salient in human perception: discrete categorization of stimuli (also known as absolute identification) and visual working memory. A software package written for the R statistical programming language is described that aids in the development of models based on rate–distortion theory.},

Finally, in order to place the subject in the appropriate historical and conceptual context we trace the main roots of Kolmogorov complexity. This way the stage is set for Chapters 2 and 3, where we introduce the notion of optimal effective descriptions of objects. The length of such a description (or the number of bits of information in it) is its Kolmogorov complexity. We treat all aspects of the elementary mathematical theory of Kolmogorov complexity. This body of knowledge may be called algo rithmic complexity theory. The theory of Martin-Lof tests for random ness of finite objects and infinite sequences is inextricably intertwined with the theory of Kolmogorov complexity and is completely treated. We also investigate the statistical properties of finite strings with high Kolmogorov complexity. Both of these topics are eminently useful in the applications part of the book. We also investigate the recursion theoretic properties of Kolmogorov complexity (relations with Godel's incompleteness result), and the Kolmogorov complexity version of infor mation theory, which we may call "algorithmic information theory" or "absolute information theory.

It provides a set of significant challenges to, and critiques of, contemporary Western psychotherapy both at the level of theory and of practice. Although a substantial amount of writing that seeks to describe and delineate the theoretical underpinnings of existential psychotherapy already exists, this is not the case with texts dealing with the application of theory in the form of practice.   Practising Existential Psychotherapy examines the unique qualities and possibilities of an existential approach to psychotherapy. Drawn from Ernesto Spinelli's own experience as an internationally recognised theorist, lecturer and practitioner, the book's overall aim is to provide a thorough and accessible explication of existential psychotherapy in practice.   Beginning with an overview of the theoretical underpinnings and distinguishing features of existential psychotherapy, the text describes and develops a three-phase structural model for its practice. As well as describing the key components of each phase, the text provides descriptive examples and topic-focused exercises designed to assist readers in developing their own practice-based understanding of existential psychotherapy.

However, we have to be able to put the pieces together in a reasonable way, which necessitates both advances in our theoretical models and development of new methodological techniques.  The primary goal of this volume is to present cutting-edge examples of mining large-scale and naturalistic data to discover important principles of cognition and evaluate theories that would not be possible without such a scale. This book also has a mission to stimulate cognitive scientists to consider new ways to harness big data in order to enhance our understanding of fundamental cognitive processes. Finally, this book aims to warn of the potential pitfalls of using, or being over-reliant on, big data and to show how big data can work alongside traditional, rigorously gathered experimental data rather than simply supersede it.  In sum, this groundbreaking volume presents cognitive scientists and those in related fields with an exciting, detailed, stimulating, and realistic introduction to big data – and to show how it may greatly advance our understanding of the principles of human memory, perception, categorization, decision-making, language, problem-solving, and representation.},

In this work, we (1) attempt to revise the ontology of levels of biological organization and clarify the relationship between the economic and genealogical hierarchies; (2) explore the implications of network theory for evolutionary dynamics in a hierarchical context; and (3) elucidate evolutionary causality by disentangling abiotic drivers from proximal evolutionary processes (the origin and sorting of variation) and their integration across hierarchies. We suggest that a pervasive pattern of stability in living systems across scale results from the architecture of nature’s economy itself—biological systems consisting of hierarchically nested, complex networks are extremely robust to extrinsic perturbations. We further argue that instances of evolution are episodic and rapid; they are transient between equilibrial states that ensue when network stability is compromised by sufficiently strong disturbances affecting biological entities at multiple levels of organization. We also claim that environmental abiotic factors are ultimately responsible for these perturbations that, when filtered through the economic hierarchy, shape the patterns of diversity and disparity of life as we know it.},

	abstract = {The natural world is infinitely complex and hierarchically structured, with smaller units forming the components of progressively larger systems: molecules make up cells, cells comprise tissues and organs that are, in turn, parts of individual organisms, which are united into populations and integrated into yet more encompassing ecosystems. In the face of such awe-inspiring complexity, there is a need for a comprehensive, non-reductionist evolutionary theory. Having emerged at the crossroads of paleobiology, genetics, and developmental biology, the hierarchical approach to evolution provides a unifying perspective on the natural world and offers an operational framework for scientists seeking to understand the way complex biological systems work and evolve. Coedited by one of the founders of hierarchy theory and featuring a diverse and renowned group of contributors, this volume provides an integrated, comprehensive, cutting-edge introduction to the hierarchy theory of evolution. From sweeping historical reviews to philosophical pieces, theoretical essays, and strictly empirical chapters, it reveals hierarchy theory as a vibrant field of scientific enterprise that holds promise for unification across the life sciences and offers new venues of empirical and theoretical research. Stretching from molecules to the biosphere, hierarchy theory aims to provide an all-encompassing understanding of evolution and—with this first collection devoted entirely to the concept—will help make transparent the fundamental patterns that propel living systems.},

	abstract = {The world’s most revered and eloquent interpreter of evolutionary ideas offers here a work of explanatory force unprecedented in our time—a landmark publication, both for its historical sweep and for its scientific vision. With characteristic attention to detail, Stephen Jay Gould first describes the content and discusses the history and origins of the three core commitments of classical Darwinism: that natural selection works on organisms, not genes or species; that it is almost exclusively the mechanism of adaptive evolutionary change; and that these changes are incremental, not drastic. Next, he examines the three critiques that currently challenge this classic Darwinian edifice: that selection operates on multiple levels, from the gene to the group; that evolution proceeds by a variety of mechanisms, not just natural selection; and that causes operating at broader scales, including catastrophes, have figured prominently in the course of evolution. Then, in a stunning tour de force that will likely stimulate discussion and debate for decades, Gould proposes his own system for integrating these classical commitments and contemporary critiques into a new structure of evolutionary thought. In 2001 the Library of Congress named Stephen Jay Gould one of America’s eighty-three Living Legends—people who embody the “quintessentially American ideal of individual creativity, conviction, dedication, and exuberance.” Each of these qualities finds full expression in this peerless work, the likes of which the scientific world has not seen—and may not see again—for well over a century.},

	abstract = {Developmental constraints (defined as biases on the production of variant phenotypes or limitations on phenotypic variability caused by the structure, character, composition, or dynamics of the developmental system) undoubtedly play a significant role in evolution. Yet there is little agreement on their importance as compared with selection, drift, and other such factors in shaping evolutionary history. This review distinguishes between "universal" and "local" constraints; it deals primarily with the latter, which apply to a limited range of taxa. Such constraints, typically, can be broken even within the taxa to which they apply, though with varying degrees of difficulty. The origin of constraints is discussed, five distinctive of constraint being explicitly considered. Three means of identifying constraints are set forth, as well as four means of distinguishing developmental from selective constraints. None of the latter (use of a priori adaptive predictions, direct measurement of selection, direct measurement of heritable variation, and use of the comparative method) is foolproof. In the final section, three larger issues regarding the role of developmental constraints in evolution are discussed: the extent to which evolutionary stasis can be explained in developmental terms, the extend to which evolutionary trends and patterns might be a consequence of developmental constraints, and the extent to which various genetic and developmental mechanisms have evolved in virtue of the need of lineages to manifest evolutionary plasticity (or adaptability) if they are to survive. Although no definitive conclusions are reached on these larger issues, we bring recent advances in developmental biology, evolutionary theory, and (to a limited extent) molecular biology to bear on them.},

Estimates of heritability cluster strongly within functional domains, and across all traits the reported heritability is 49\%. For a majority (69\%) of traits, the observed twin correlations are consistent with a simple and parsimonious model where twin resemblance is solely due to additive genetic variation. The data are inconsistent with substantial influences from shared environment or non-additive genetic variation. This study provides the most comprehensive analysis of the causes of individual differences in human traits thus far and will guide future gene-mapping efforts.

	abstract = {Recent theories in cognitive science have begun to focus on the active role of organisms in shaping their own environment, and the role of these environmental resources for cognition. Approaches such as situated, embedded, ecological, distributed and particularly extended cognition look beyond ‘what is inside your head’ to the old Gibsonian question of ‘what your head is inside of’ and with which it forms a wider whole—its internal and external cognitive niche. Since these views have been treated as a radical departure from the received view of cognition, their proponents have looked for support to similar extended views within (the philosophy of) biology, most notably the theory of niche construction. This paper argues that there is an even closer and more fruitful parallel with developmental systems theory and developmental niche construction. These ask not ‘what is inside the genes you inherited’, but ‘what the inherited genes are inside of’ and with which they form a wider whole—their internal and external ontogenetic niche, understood as the set of epigenetic, social, ecological, epistemic and symbolic legacies inherited by the organism as necessary developmental resources. To the cognizing agent, the epistemic niche presents itself not just as a partially self-engineered selective niche, as the niche construction paradigm will have it, but even more so as a partially self-engineered ontogenetic niche, a problem-solving resource and scaffold for individual development and learning. This move should be beneficial for coming to grips with our own (including cognitive) nature: what is most distinctive about humans is their developmentally plastic brains immersed into a well-engineered, cumulatively constructed cognitive–developmental niche.},

Advocates of niche construction theory (NCT) believe that standard evolutionary theory fails to recognize the full importance of niche construction, and consequently propose a novel view of evolution, in which niche construction and its legacy over time (ecological inheritance) are described as evolutionary processes, equivalent in importance to natural selection. Here, we subject NCT to critical evaluation, in the form of a collaboration between one prominent advocate of NCT, and a team of skeptics. We discuss whether niche construction is an evolutionary process, whether NCT obscures or clarifies how natural selection leads to organismal adaptation, and whether niche construction and natural selection are of equivalent explanatory importance. We also consider whether the literature that promotes NCT overstates the significance of niche construction, whether it is internally coherent, and whether it accurately portrays standard evolutionary theory. Our disagreements reflect a wider dispute within evolutionary theory over whether the neo-Darwinian synthesis is in need of reformulation, as well as different usages of some key terms (e.g., evolutionary process).},

We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the magnitude of the Flynn effect with a higher degree of precision, to determine the error of measurement, and to assess the impact of several moderator variables on the mean effect size. Across 285 studies (N = 14,031) since 1951 with administrations of two intelligence tests with different normative bases, the meta-analytic mean was 2.31, 95\% CI [1.99, 2.64], standard score points per decade. The mean effect size for 53 comparisons (N = 3,951) (excluding three atypical studies that inflate the estimates) involving modern (since 1972) Stanford-Binet and Wechsler IQ tests (2.93, 95\% CI [2.3, 3.5], IQ points per decade) was comparable to previous estimates of about 3 points per decade, but not consistent with the hypothesis that the Flynn effect is diminishing. For modern tests, study sample (larger increases for validation research samples vs. test standardization samples) and order of administration explained unique variance in the Flynn effect, but age and ability level were not significant moderators. These results supported previous estimates of the Flynn effect and its robustness across different age groups, measures, samples, and levels of performance.},

While “narrow” artificial intelligence which focuses on solving specific problems such as speech recognition, text comprehension, visual pattern recognition and robotic motion has shown impressive breakthroughs lately, understanding general intelligence remains elusive. We propose a paradigm shift from intelligence perceived as a competence of individual agents defined in relation to an a priori given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative process of self-organisation. We call this process open-ended intelligence. Starting with a brief introduction of the current conceptual approach, we expose a number of serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the concept of intelligence. Open-ended intelligence is then developed as an abstraction of the process of human cognitive development, so its application can be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three facets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation, sense-making and the individuation of general cognitive agents. We further show how open-ended intelligence can be framed in terms of a distributed, self-organising network of interacting elements and how such process is scalable. The framework highlights an important relation between coordination and intelligence and a new understanding of values.},

It is then used to assess the eight strategies, which are organized into three main approaches: representationalism, semi-representationalism and non-representationalism.

	abstract = {The symbol grounding problem (SGP), which remains difficult for AI and philosophy of information, was recently scrutinised by Taddeo and Floridi (Solving the symbol grounding problem: A critical review of fifteen years of research. Journal of Experimental \& Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 17, 419–445, 2005; A praxical solution of the symbol grounding problem. Minds and machines, 17, 369–389, doi:10.1007/s11023-007-9081-32005, 2007). However, their own solution to SGP, underwritten by Action-based Semantics, although different from other solutions, does not seem to be satisfactory. Moreover, it does not satisfy the authors' principle, which they dub ‘Zero Semantic Commitment Condition’. In this paper, Taddeo and Floridi's solution is criticised in particular because of the excessively liberal relationship between symbols and internal states of agents, which is conceived in terms of levels of abstraction. Also, the notion of action seems to be seriously defective in their theory. Due to the lack of the possibility of symbols to misrepresent, the grounded symbols remain useless for the cognitive system itself, and it is unclear why they should be grounded in the first place, as the role of grounded symbols is not specified by the proposed solution. At the same time, it is probably one of the best-developed attempts to solve SGP and shows that naturalised semantics can benefit from taking artificial intelligence seriously.},

But we insist that they should be grounded not only in subsymbolic activities, but also in the interaction between the agent and the world. The point is that concepts are not formed in isolation (from the world), in abstraction, or "objectively." They are formed in relation to the experience of agents, through their perceptual/motor apparatuses, in their world and linked to their goals and actions. This paper takes a detailed look at this relatively old issue, with a new perspective, aided by our work of computational cognitive model development. To further our understanding, we also go back in time to link up with earlier philosophical theories related to this issue. The result is an account that extends from computational mechanisms to philosophical abstractions.},

We chart advances over the past several decades that address challenges of perception and action under uncertainty through the lens of computation. Advances include the development of representations and inferential procedures for large-scale probabilistic inference and machinery for enabling reflection and decisions about tradeoffs in effort, precision, and timeliness of computations. These tools are deployed toward the goal of computational rationality: identifying decisions with highest expected utility, while taking into consideration the costs of computation in complex real-world problems in which most relevant calculations can only be approximated. We highlight key concepts with examples that show the potential for interchange between computer science, cognitive science, and neuroscience.},

	abstract = {The human cognitive system is a remarkable exemplar of a general intelligent system whose competence is not confined to a specific problem domain. Evidently, general cognitive competences are a product of a prolonged and complex process of cognitive development. Therefore, the process of cognitive development is a primary key to understanding the emergence of intelligent behavior. This paper develops the theoretical foundations for a model that generalizes the process of cognitive development. The model aims to provide a realistic scheme for the synthesis of scalable cognitive systems with an open-ended range of capabilities. Major concepts and theories of human cognitive development are introduced and briefly explored, focusing on the enactive approach to cognition and the concept of sense-making. The initial scheme of human cognitive development is then generalized by introducing the philosophy of individuation and the abstract mechanism of transduction. The theory of individuation provides the ground for the necessary paradigmatic shift from cognitive systems as given products to cognitive development as a formative process of self-organization. Next, the conceptual model is specified as a scalable scheme of networks of agents. The mechanisms of individuation are formulated in context-independent information theoretical terms. Finally, the paper discusses two concrete aspects of the generative model – mechanisms of transduction and value modulating systems. These are topics of further research towards an implementable architecture.},

Our point of departure is Simondon's (1992) theory of individuation, which we integrate with the enactive theory of cognition (Di Paolo et al., 2010) and Luhmann's (1996) theory of social systems. This forges a novel view of social systems as complex, individuating sequences of communicative interactions that together constitute distributed yet distinct cognitive agencies, acquiring a capacity to exert influence over their human-constituted environment. We conclude that the resulting framework suggests several different paths of integrating AI agents into human society. One path suggests the emulation of a largely simplified version of the human mind, reduced in its functions to a specific triple selection-making which is necessary for sustaining social systems. Another one conceives AI systems that follow the distributed, autonomous architecture of social systems, instead that of humans.},

These differences are required because distributed systems require that the programmer be aware of latency, have a different model of memory access, and take into account issues of concurrency and partial failure. We look at a number of distributed systems that have attempted to paper over the distinction between local and remote objects, and show that such systems fail to support basic requirements of robustness and reliability. These failures have been masked in the past by the small size of the distributed systems that have been built. In the enterprise-wide distributed systems foreseen in the near future, however, such a masking will be impossible. We conclude by discussing what is required of both systems-level and application-level programmers and designers if one is to take distribution seriously.},

	abstract = {In the big data era, graph computing is one of the challenging issues because there are numerous large graph datasets emerging from real applications. A question is: do we need to know the final exact answer for a large graph? When it is impossible to know the exact answer in a limited time, is it possible to approximate the final answer in an automatic and systematic way without having to designing new approximate algorithms? The main idea behind the question is: it is more important to find out something meaningful quick from a large graph, and we should focus on finding a way of making use of large graphs instead of spending time on designing approximate algorithms. In this paper, we give an innovative approach which automatically and systematically synthesizes a program to approximate the original program. We show that we can give users some answers with reasonable accuracy and high efficiency for a wide spectrum of graph algorithms, without having to know the details of graph algorithms. We have conducted extensive experimental studies using many graph algorithms that are supported in the existing graph systems and large real graphs. Our extensive experimental results reveal that our automatically approximating approach is highly feasible.},

	abstract = {Whatever you may have heard about product hackers, the truth is they do something really, really\&lt;br/\&gt;well. In short: “hackers build things, crackers break them.” Through their experiential and social\&lt;br/\&gt;approach product hackers discover new possibilities in a frugal manner with the local resources\&lt;br/\&gt;and skills at hand. The human race has built up a rich history in adapting and designing his living\&lt;br/\&gt;environment and surrounding artifacts. Although the phenomenon of product hacking has been\&lt;br/\&gt;around for a long time, it’s manifestation has drastically changed through several paradigm shifts\&lt;br/\&gt;within the DIY culture which lead to open-design. These shifts imply that professional designers are\&lt;br/\&gt;no longer placed above users when determining what is right or wrong for them. Within the context\&lt;br/\&gt;of design for disability this perspective opens-up a complementary alternative to universal design.\&lt;br/\&gt;Today there are a lot of people with disabilities whose assistive devices have not yet come about,\&lt;br/\&gt;due to unique needs and challenges. A new generation of makers and occupational therapists are\&lt;br/\&gt;seizing this opportunity by producing one of a kind product adaptations in people’s homes, sheltered\&lt;br/\&gt;workshops and rehabilitation centers.\&lt;br/\&gt;This dissertation explores the role of professional designers within this new and open-ended context.\&lt;br/\&gt;In general the research focus is on the epistemic dynamics of hacking behavior within the\&lt;br/\&gt;pursuit of making a tailored product adaptation for a single user. Generally speaking collaborative\&lt;br/\&gt;hacking activities are a form of self-organizing co-design activities driven by participatory prototyping-\&lt;br/\&gt;interactions. For this reason, the starting point of this thesis was the question : “How do specific\&lt;br/\&gt;prototyping-interactions influence general adaptation within participatory hacking behavior?” To\&lt;br/\&gt;answer this question we propose a framework which illustrates hacking entities as a self-regulating\&lt;br/\&gt;systems. A cybernetic design approach was chosen to develop a framework to explain the circular\&lt;br/\&gt;causality and relationships within local hacking ecologies. We list the minimum conditions and elements\&lt;br/\&gt;of an autonomous hacking entity in order for it to be able to adapt to changing circumstances\&lt;br/\&gt;and ‘to get what it wants’. With his holistic thinking, it integrates the surroundings as part of the\&lt;br/\&gt;a self-regulating system by means of two adaptation types, namely single and double-loop adaptation.\&lt;br/\&gt;Both loops enact respectively as an (1) active (agents actively change their environments\&lt;br/\&gt;through external adaptation) and (2) passive (agents compulsory change their internal construction\&lt;br/\&gt;of the environment through internal adaptation) component of adaptation. Although both type of\&lt;br/\&gt;adaptations are strongly intertwined we tried to illustrated them through the variety of data from\&lt;br/\&gt;living lab practices and illustrate how they self-organize the hacking process.},

	doi = {10.1145/568547.568561},
	abstract = {Practically all programming languages have some form of control structure or jumping. The more advanced forms of control structure tend to resemble function calls, so much so that they are usually not even described as jumps. Consider for example the library function exit in C. Its use is much like a function, in that it may be called with an argument; but the whole point of exit is of course that its behaviour is utterly non-functional, in that it jumps out of arbitrarily many surrounding blocks and pending function calls. Such a "non-returning function" or "jump with arguments" is an example of a continuation in the sense which we are interested in here.On the other hand, a simple but fundamental idea in compiling is that a function call is broken down into two jumps: one from the caller to the callee for the call itself, and another jump back from the callee to the caller upon returning. (The return statement in C is in fact listed among the "jump statements" [5].) This is most obvious for void-accepting and -returning functions, but it generalizes to other functions as well, if one is willing to understand "jump" in the broader sense of jump with arguments, i.e. continuation.In this view, then, continuations are everywhere. Continuations have been used in many different settings, in which they appear in different guises, ranging from mathematical functions to machine addresses. Rather than confine ourselves to a definition of what a continuation is, we will focus on continuation-passing style (CPS), as it brings out the commonalities. The CPS transform compresses a great deal of insight into three little equations in λ-calculus. Making sense of it intuitively, however, requires some background knowledge and a certain fluency. The purpose of this article, therefore, is to help the reader uncompress the CPS transform by way of a rational reconstruction from jumps.In the sequel, we will attempt to illustrate the correspondence between continuations and jumps (even in the guise of the abhorred goto). The intent is partly historical, to retrace some of the analysis of jumps that led to the discoveries of continuations. At the same time, the language of choice for many researchers during the (pre)history of continuations, ALGOL 60, is not so different from today's mainstream languages (i.e. C); we hope that occasional snippets of C may be more easily accessible to many readers than a functional language would be. So in each of the four sections (Sections 2-5 below) that make up the body of this paper, some C code will be used to give a naive but concrete example of the issue under consideration, before generalizing to a more abstract setting.},

By what mechanism does a person experience that "Aha!" moment, when sudden clarity emerges from a tangled web of thoughts and ideas? This research integrates psychological work on insight with graph theoretic work on "small-world" phenomenon, to construct a theory that explains how insight occurs, how it is similar to and different from more typical learning processes, and why it yields an affective response in the individual. I propose that cognitive insight occurs when an atypical association, forged through random recombination or directed search, results in a "shortcut" in an individual's network of representations. This causes a rapid decrease in path length, reorients the individual's understanding of the relationships within and among the affected representations, and can prompt a cascade of other connections. This result is demonstrated by applying graph theoretical analysis to network translations of commonly used insight problems.},

Have you ever found yourself working with a spreadsheet full of data and wishing you could make more sense of the numbers?  Have you reviewed sales or operations reports, wondering if there’s a better way to anticipate your customers’ needs?  Perhaps you’ve even thought to yourself: There’s got to be more to these figures than what I’m seeing! Data Mining can help, and you don’t need a Ph.D. in Computer Science to do it.  You can forecast staffing levels, predict demand for inventory, even sift through millions of lines of customer emails looking for common themes—all using data mining.  It’s easier than you might think. In Data Mining for the Masses, professor Matt North—a former risk analyst and database developer for eBay.com—uses simple examples, clear explanations and free, powerful, easy-to-use software to teach you the basics of data mining; techniques that can help you answer some of your toughest business questions. You’ve got data and you know it’s got value, if only you can figure out how to unlock it.  This book can show you how.  Let’s start digging!

How does mere matter give rise to all these non-material mental states, including consciousness itself? An answer to this central question of our existence is emerging at the busy intersection of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, and robotics. In this groundbreaking work, philosopher and cognitive scientist Andy Clark explores exciting new theories from these fields that reveal minds like ours to be prediction machines - devices that have evolved to anticipate the incoming streams of sensory stimulation before they arrive. These predictions then initiate actions that structure our worlds and alter the very things we need to engage and predict. Clark takes us on a journey in discovering the circular causal flows and the self-structuring of the environment that define "the predictive brain." What emerges is a bold, new, cutting-edge vision that reveals the brain as our driving force in the daily surf through the waves of sensory stimulation.},

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

After reading The Golden Ticket, I sort of hope P isn't NP after all."--Vint Cerf, Google Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist and one of the "Fathers of the Internet""The P-NP problem is fundamental to computer science, and indeed all of mathematics. This book presents an engaging exposition of the problem, its history, and importance. In the process, it touches on major topics appearing in university computer science courses, all presented in an amusing style requiring no background in mathematics beyond the ability to solve Sudoku puzzles. I highly recommend it."--Stephen Cook, formulator of the P-NP problem"This book, written by a world-class master of the field, is a grand tour of the most celebrated and profound unsolved problem in computer science. Fortnow's many ingenious explanations make the mysteries of computational complexity accessible to anyone interested in the fundamental questions: what can be computed and how fast can we compute it?"--John MacCormick, author of Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future"This book is meticulous. Fortnow has really tracked down the history and background of this important and timely subject. Even complexity theorists will benefit from his fine scholarship. The Golden Ticket is the first of its kind--a book for general readers about complexity theory."--William Gasarch, University of Maryland"Nobody explains the importance of the P-NP problem better than Fortnow."--William J.

	abstract = {The human cerebral cortex is central to a wide array of cognitive functions, from vision to language, reasoning, decision-making, and motor control. Yet, nearly a century after the neuroanatomical organization of the cortex was first defined, its basic logic remains unknown. One hypothesis is that cortical neurons form a single, massively repeated “canonical” circuit, characterized as a kind of a “nonlinear spatiotemporal filter with adaptive properties” (1). In this classic view, it was “assumed that these…properties are identical for all neocortical areas.” Nearly four decades later, there is still no consensus about whether such a canonical circuit exists, either in terms of its anatomical basis or its function. Likewise, there is little evidence that such uniform architectures can capture the diversity of cortical function in simple mammals, let alone characteristically human processes such as language and abstract thinking (2). Analogous software implementations in artificial intelligence (e.g., deep learning networks) have proven effective in certain pattern classification tasks, such as speech and image recognition, but likewise have made little inroads in areas such as reasoning and natural language understanding. Is the search for a single canonical cortical circuit misguided?

They need to provide the capacity for intricate and idiosyncratic arrangements, total modifiability, undecided alternatives, and thorough internal documentation. I want to explain how some ideas developed and what they are. The original problem was to specify a computer system for personal information retrieval and documentation, able to do some rather complicated things in clear and simple ways. In this paper I will explain the original problem. Then I will explain why the problem is not simple, and why the solution (a file structure) must yet be very simple. The file structure suggested here is the Evolutionary List File, to be built of zippered lists. A number of uses will be suggested for such a file, to show the breadth of its potential usefulness. Finally, I want to explain the philosophical implications of this approach for information retrieval and data structure in a changing world.},

Attempts to formalize the notion of emergence via algorithmic complexity theory runs into the problem that the Kolmogorov complexity function is not computable. The reason for this motivates a closer examination of the link between emergence and universal computation. Following Wolfram's pioneering work in the classification of cellular automata behavior, the research programs of Langton and Crutchfield, while incomplete, provide important insights to economists seeking to understand the relevance of emergence and universal computation to their discipline. They lead to questions on the emergence of institutions and the concomitant changes in rule-based behavior on the part of economic agents.},

While there has been substantial progress in developing ontologies for types of products and services, namely eClassOWL, this alone does not provide the representational means required for e-commerce on the Semantic Web. Particularly missing is an ontology that allows describing the relationships between (1) Web resources, (2) offerings made by means of those Web resources, (3) legal entities, (4) prices, (5) terms and conditions, and the aforementioned ontologies for products and services (6). For example, we must be able to say that a particular Web site describes an offer to sell cell phones of a certain make and model at a certain price, that a piano house offers maintenance for pianos that weigh less than 150 kg, or that a car rental company leases out cars of a certain make and model from a set of branches across the country.

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to discuss some  organizational aspects of programs using the  actor model of computation. In this paper we  present an approach to modelling intelligence  in terms of a society of communicating  knowledge-based problem-solving experts. In  turn each of the experts can be viewed as a  society that can be further decomposed in the  same way until th primitive actors fo the  system are reached. We are investigating the  nature of the communication mechanisms  needed for effective problem-solving by a  society of experts and the conventions of  discourse that make this possible. In this way  we hope eventually to develop a framework  adequate for the discussion of the central  issues of problem-solving involving parallel  versus serial processing and centralization  versus decentralization of control and  information storage.},

	abstract = {The vertex-centric programming model is an established computational paradigm recently incorporated into distributed processing frameworks to address challenges in large-scale graph processing. Billion-node graphs that exceed the memory capacity of commodity machines are not well supported by popular Big Data tools like MapReduce, which are notoriously poor performing for iterative graph algorithms such as PageRank. In response, a new type of framework challenges one to “think like a vertex” (TLAV) and implements user-defined programs from the perspective of a vertex rather than a graph. Such an approach improves locality, demonstrates linear scalability, and provides a natural way to express and compute many iterative graph algorithms. These frameworks are simple to program and widely applicable but, like an operating system, are composed of several intricate, interdependent components, of which a thorough understanding is necessary in order to elicit top performance at scale. To this end, the first comprehensive survey of TLAV frameworks is presented. In this survey, the vertex-centric approach to graph processing is overviewed, TLAV frameworks are deconstructed into four main components and respectively analyzed, and TLAV implementations are reviewed and categorized.},

	shorttitle = {Actors},
	abstract = {A foundational model of concurrency is developed in this thesis. It examines issues in the design of parallel systems and show why the actor model is suitable for exploiting large-scale parallelism. Concurrency in actors is constrained only by the availability of hardware resources and by the logical dependence inherent in the computation. Unlike dataflow and functional programming, however, actors are dynamically reconfigurable and can model shared resources with changing local state. Concurrency is spawned in actors using asynchronous message-passing, pipelining, and the dynamic creation of actors. The author defines an abstract actor machine and provide a minimal programming language for it. A more expressive language, which includes higher level constructs such as delayed and eager evaluation, can be defined in terms of the primitives. Examples are given to illustrate the ease with which concurrent data and control structures can be programmed. This thesis deals with some central issues in distributed computing. Specifically, problems of divergence and deadlock are addressed. Additional keywords: Object oriented programming; Semantics.},

Together these contributors paint a picture of Futures Studies not so much a product of the stale intellectual heritage of the 20th century, but as a vibrant harbinger of intellectual perspectives sure to gain wider currency in the 21st. Drawing on their backgrounds in fields as diverse as political science, history, sociology, anthropology, economics, psychology, management, and human ecology, this international line-up of contributors includes world systems theorist Immanuel Wallerstein, philosopher Peter Manicas, management professor Bill Halal, and industrial sociologist Arthur Shostak.},

Using the immune system and certain aspects of its functions as a primary model, this book examines many of the most interesting and troubling questions posed by complex systems. How do systems choose the right set of agents to perform appropriate actions with appropriate intensities at appropriate times? How in the immune system, ant colonies and metabolic networks does the diffusion and binding of a large variety of chemicals to their receptors permit coordination of system action? What advantages drive the various systems to complexity, and by what mechanisms do the systems cope with the tendency toward unwieldiness and randomness of large complex systems?\}},

By using cryptographic and other security mechanisms, we can secure many algorithmically specifiable relationships from breach by principals, and from eavesdropping or malicious interference by third parties, up to considerations of time, user interface, and completeness of the algorithmic specification.

It also includes a new edition of Konrad Zuse's “Calculating Space” (the MIT translation), and a panel discussion transcription on the topic, featuring worldwide experts in quantum mechanics, physics, cognition, computation and algorithmic complexity.The volume is dedicated to the memory of Alan M Turing — the inventor of universal computation, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, and is part of the Turing Centenary celebrations.},

Its earliest formulation by Francisco Varela, Humberto Maturana, and Ricardo Uribe was seminal in demonstrating the use of an artificial, computational medium to explore the most basic question of the abstract nature of living systems—over a decade in advance of the first Santa Fe Workshop on Artificial Life. The research program it originated has generated substantive demonstrations of progressively richer, lifelike phenomena. It has also sharply illuminated both conceptual and methodological problems in the field. This article provides an integrative overview of the sometimes disparate work in this area, and argues that computational autopoiesis continues to provide an effective framework for addressing key open problems in artificial life.},

The consequence is that the Web, often termed the global marketplace, is fragmented along the dimensions of geography, content domain, supply or demand, user base, and many more. This fragmentation makes it inefficient to buy and sell commodities on the Web. We propose a framework that serves as a foundation for a distributed, de-centralized e-marketplace on top of the Web, making boundaries between existing systems disappear from the user's perspective. The framework standardizes the creation and description of objects that represent supply and demand. In addition to this, it allows for independent matching services to connect objects suitable for a transaction and it defines protocols for the message exchange between such objects.},

The evolutionary formation of a complex gut microbiota in mammals has played an important role in enabling brain development and perhaps sophisticated social interaction. Genes within the human gut microbiota, termed the microbiome, significantly outnumber human genes in the body, and are capable of producing a myriad of neuroactive compounds. Gut microbes are part of the unconscious system regulating behavior. Recent investigations indicate that these microbes majorly impact on cognitive function and fundamental behavior patterns, such as social interaction and stress management. In the absence of microbes, underlying neurochemistry is profoundly altered. Studies of gut microbes may play an important role in advancing understanding of disorders of cognitive functioning and social interaction, such as autism.},

Next, we discuss some drawbacks derived from neo-Darwinian presuppositions underlying these positions, especially organism-environment dualism, molecular gene theory, and animal-machine analogies. To highlight these limitations, we place these problems in a broader context by discussing relevant theories in biology and exploring parallels between these theories and related ideas in psychology. This reframing allows an evaluation of the degree to which these three new views offer more coherent answers to central questions in ecology and development than have previous theories. The chapter ends with a summary of the contributions made by ecological realism, dynamic systems, and epigenetic systems to overcoming these difficulties.

stands in sharp contrast to the philosophy underlying Newtonian science, which is
based on reductionism, determinism, and objective knowledge. This paper reviews
the historical development of this new world view, focusing on its philosophical
foundations. Determinism was challenged by quantum mechanics and chaos theory.
Systems theory replaced reductionism by a scientifically based holism. Cybernetics
and postmodern social science showed that knowledge is intrinsically subjective.
These developments are being integrated under the header of “complexity science”.
Its central paradigm is the multi-agent system. Agents are intrinsically subjective
and uncertain about their environment and future, but out of their local interactions,
a global organization emerges. Although different philosophers, and in particular the
postmodernists, have voiced similar ideas, the paradigm of complexity still needs to
be fully assimilated by philosophy. This will throw a new light on old philosophical
issues such as relativism, ethics and the role of the subject.},

To answer this question, we investigate whether completeness and transitivity necessarily hold when agents choose outcome rationally—that is, their choice sequences do not lead to dominated outcomes. We show that, because of the danger of money pumps and other manipulations, outcome rationality implies that agents must have transitive psychological preferences. Revealed preferences, on the other hand, must be complete since agents can be forced to choose from any set of options. But these justifications of transitivity and completeness cannot be combined. We show that if psychological preferences are incomplete then revealed preferences can be intransitive without exposing agents to manipulations or violating outcome rationality. We also show that a specific case of nonstandard behavior, status quo maintenance, is outcome-rational in the simple environments considered in the experimental literature, but not in more complex settings.},

	abstract = {The main paradigm we presently use to understand our universe is theoretical physics. It has helped us understand much about space, time, energy, and matter but does not presently explain or predict the emergence of information, computation, life, and mind. In biological systems, the discipline of evolutionary development (evo-devo) biology studies how evolutionary and developmental processes interact to guide the production of ordered, complex, adaptive, and intelligent structures. In living systems, we can distinguish evolutionary processes, which are stochastic, variety-creating, divergent, and contingently adaptive, and developmental processes, which produce convergent and systemically statistically predictable structures and trajectories in a hierarchical developmental cycle, from seed, to adult, to reproduction, aging, and death. If our universe is also a cycling, evo devo system, that moves from seed, to adult, to reproduction and death, as several scientists and philosophers now suspect, it must also exhibit both unpredictable evolutionary creativity over its life span and many predictable and constraining developmental constants, functions, and futures, as it grows up, reproduces, and dies. As science learns to see our universe as an evo-devo system, our foresight will greatly improve, and humanity will gain new moral responsibilities, both to predict and help developmental processes unfold, and to increase evolutionary free choice and diversity of paths.},

Life through Time and Space brings together the latest discoveries in both biology and astronomy to examine our deepest questions about where we came from, where we are going, and whether we are alone in the cosmos.A distinctive voice in the growing field of astrobiology, Wallace Arthur combines embryological, evolutionary, and cosmological perspectives to tell the story of life on Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere in the universe. He guides us on a journey through the myriad events that started with the big bang and led to the universe we inhabit today. Along the way, readers learn about the evolution of life from a primordial soup of organic molecules to complex plants and animals, about Earth’s geological transformation from barren rock to diverse ecosystems, and about human development from embryo to infant to adult. Arthur looks closely at the history of mass extinctions and the prospects for humanity’s future on our precious planet.Do intelligent aliens exist on a distant planet in the Milky Way, sharing the three origins that characterize all life on Earth? In addressing this question, Life through Time and Space tackles the many riddles of our place and fate in the universe that have intrigued human beings since they first gazed in wonder at the nighttime sky.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) as a discipline is concerned, among other things, with discovering and understanding the role of changes in developmental mechanisms in the evolutionary origin of aspects of the phenotype. In a very real sense, Evo-Devo opens the black box between genotype and phenotype, or more properly, phenotypes as multiple life history stages arise in many organisms from a single genotype. Changes in the timing or positioning of an aspect of development in a descendant relative to an ancestor (heterochrony and heterotopy) were two evolutionary developmental mechanisms identified by Ernst Haeckel in the 1870s. Many more have since been identified, in large part because of our enhanced understanding of development and because new mechanisms emerge as development proceeds: the transfer from maternal to zygotic genomic control; cell-to-cell interactions; cell differentiation and cell migration; embryonic inductions; functional interactions at the tissue and organ levels; growth. Within these emergent processes, gene networks and gene cascades (genetic modules) link the genotype with morphogenetic units (cellular modules, namely germ layers, embryonic fields or cellular condensations), while epigenetic processes such as embryonic inductions, tissue interactions and functional integration, link morphogenetic units to the phenotype. Evolutionary developmental mechanisms also include interactions between individuals of the same species, individuals of different species, and species and their biotic and/or abiotic environment. Such interactions link ecological communities. Importantly, there is little to distinguish the causality that underlies these interactions from that which underlies inductive interactions within embryos.},

Many such interactions are known as cyclomorphosis or seasonal polymorphism , both of which are examples of phenotypic plasticity.Chapter 19 then moves us to genetic assimilation, the other major mechanism by which environmental signals trigger changes in development. Then, in Chapter 20, I present a quantitative genetics model that integrates epigenetic and environmental factors into analyses of morphological change in development and evolution. The generality of the model is supported by its elaboration for mammalian mandibles and eyespots on butterfly wings.},

This classic observation has long been viewed as an emphatic realization of the principle of common descent.

Here, we focus on early embryonic development and discuss several lines of evidence, from recent molecular data, through developmental networks to life-history strategies, that indicate that early animal embryos are not highly conserved. Bringing this evidence together, we argue that the nature of early development often reflects adaptation to diverse ecological niches. Finally, we synthesize old and new ideas to propose a model that accounts for the evolutionary process by which embryos have come to be conserved.},

The traversers move about the graph according to the instructions specified in the traversal, where the result of the computation is the ultimate locations of all halted traversers. A Gremlin machine can be executed over any supporting graph computing system such as an OLTP graph database and/or an OLAP graph processor. Gremlin, as a graph traversal language, is a functional language implemented in the user's native programming language and is used to define the traversal of a Gremlin machine. This article provides a mathematical description of Gremlin and details its automaton and functional properties. These properties enable Gremlin to naturally support imperative and declarative querying, host language agnosticism, user-defined domain specific languages, an extensible compiler/optimizer, single- and multi-machine execution models, hybrid depth- and breadth-first evaluation, as well as the existence of a Universal Gremlin Machine and its respective entailments.},

Wallace's apparent paradox can be dissolved with two hypotheses about human cognition. One is that intelligence is an adaptation to a knowledge-using, socially interdependent lifestyle, the “cognitive niche.” This embraces the ability to overcome the evolutionary fixed defenses of plants and animals by applications of reasoning, including weapons, traps, coordinated driving of game, and detoxification of plants. Such reasoning exploits intuitive theories about different aspects of the world, such as objects, forces, paths, places, states, substances, and other people's beliefs and desires. The theory explains many zoologically unusual traits in Homo sapiens, including our complex toolkit, wide range of habitats and diets, extended childhoods and long lives, hypersociality, complex mating, division into cultures, and language (which multiplies the benefit of knowledge because know-how is useful not only for its practical benefits but as a trade good with others, enhancing the evolution of cooperation). The second hypothesis is that humans possess an ability of metaphorical abstraction, which allows them to coopt faculties that originally evolved for physical problem-solving and social coordination, apply them to abstract subject matter, and combine them productively. These abilities can help explain the emergence of abstract cognition without supernatural or exotic evolutionary forces and are in principle testable by analyses of statistical signs of selection in the human genome.},

	abstract = {The Ontogeny of Information is a critical intervention into the ongoing and perpetually troubling nature-nurture debates surrounding human development. Originally published in 1985, this was a foundational text in what is now the substantial field of developmental systems theory. In this revised edition Susan Oyama argues compellingly that nature and nurture are not alternative influences on human development but, rather, developmental products and the developmental processes that produce them.	Information, says Oyama, is thought to reside in molecules, cells, tissues, and the environment. When something wondrous occurs in the world, we tend to question whether the information guiding the transformation was pre-encoded in the organism or installed through experience or instruction. Oyama looks beyond this either-or question to focus on the history of such developments. She shows that what developmental “information” does depends on what is already in place and what alternatives are available. She terms this process “constructive interactionism,” whereby each combination of genes and environmental influences simultaneously interacts to produce a unique result. Ontogeny, then, is the result of dynamic and complex interactions in multileveled developmental systems.	The Ontogeny of Information challenges specialists in the fields of developmental biology, philosophy of biology, psychology, and sociology, and even nonspecialists, to reexamine the existing nature-nurture dichotomy as it relates to the history and formation of organisms.},

Control theory is critically important in this regard because it describes and models the dynamic systems that enable control to occur. Yet, the origins and principles of control theory in psychology are often misunderstood. This leads to a failure to capitalize on its strengths as a unifying, dynamic framework. We address this gap in knowledge by describing the early origins of control theory and its 2 main paths of development within psychology, as a “man−machine system” approach, and as a “grand theory” of psychology. We introduce the grand theory approach to control theory, pioneered by William T. Powers (1926-2013). Powers (1973) proposed that behavior is the control of perception and he introduced a closed-loop, hierarchical architecture to implement this principle. We propose that Powers’ control theory provides a wholly new perspective on psychological science and is, as such, a third grand theory, after the behaviorist and cognitive theories. We describe a range of advances in neuroscience, animal behavior, social processes, and mental health, based on Powers’ theory, to illustrate its potential to transform the nature of psychological research and practice.

Similarly, social-class theorists in the Marxist tradition have often given the concept of control a prominent place, equating it with domination, without having seen the need for any close analysis of the concept. Wright (1979), for instance, defines social classes in terms of their control of economic surplus, with the “dominant class” (p. 15) exerting “control over money capital, … physical capital” and “supervision and discipline within the labor process” (p. 25). He contends, further, that members of the working class experience a corresponding “loss of control over the labor process” (p. 28). Wright then builds his theoretical exposition on these definitions without ever analyzing in any detail how such control processes work.},

After detailing the PCT model, I demonstrate one application of PCT to sociological theory by applying this perspective to questions of power and interpersonal control. I argue that social power should be distinguished from interpersonal use of force, coercion, incentives, or influence. Rather, power derives from an alignment of goals by humans acting as independent control systems. The article closes with a discussion of connections between PCT and several strands of current sociological theory.},

	abstract = {The concept of stigmergy has been used to analyze self-organizing activities in an ever-widening range of domains, including social insects, robotics, web communities and human society. Yet, it is still poorly understood and as such its full power remains underappreciated. The present paper clarifies the issue by defining stigmergy as a mechanism of indirect coordination in which the trace left by an action in a medium stimulates subsequent actions. It then analyses the fundamental concepts used in the definition: action, agent, medium, trace and coordination. It clarifies how stigmergy enables complex, coordinated activity without any need for planning, control, communication, simultaneous presence, or even mutual awareness. The resulting self-organization is driven by a combination of positive and negative feedbacks, amplifying beneficial developments while suppressing errors. Thus, stigmergy is applicable to a very broad variety of cases, from chemical reactions to bodily coordination and Internet-supported collaboration in Wikipedia.},

IIT then postulates that the physical substrate of consciousness must satisfy these very properties. We develop a detailed mathematical framework in which composition, information, integration, and exclusion are defined precisely and made operational. This allows us to establish to what extent simple systems of mechanisms, such as logic gates or neuron-like elements, can form complexes that can account for the fundamental properties of consciousness. Based on this principled approach, we show that IIT can explain many known facts about consciousness and the brain, leads to specific predictions, and allows us to infer, at least in principle, both the quantity and quality of consciousness for systems whose causal structure is known. For example, we show that some simple systems can be minimally conscious, some complicated systems can be unconscious, and two different systems can be functionally equivalent, yet one is conscious and the other one is not.},

	abstract = {The world is confronted with a variety of interdependent problems, including scarcity, unsustainability, inequality, pollution and poor governance. Tackling such complex challenges requires coordinated action. The present paper proposes the development of a self-organizing system for coordination, called an “offer network”, that would use the distributed intelligence of the Internet to match the offers and needs of all human, technological and natural agents on the planet. This would maximize synergy and thus minimize waste and scarcity of resources. Implementing such coordination requires a protocol that formally defines agents, offers, needs, and the network of condition-action rules or reactions that interconnect them. Matching algorithms can then determine self-sustaining subnetworks in which each consumed resource (need) is also produced (offer). After sketching the elements of a mathematical foundation for offer networks, the paper proposes a roadmap for their practical implementation. This includes step-by-step integration with technologies such as the Semantic Web, ontologies, the Internet of Things, reputation and recommendation systems, reinforcement learning, governance through legal constraints and nudging, and ecosystem modeling. The resulting intelligent platform should be able to tackle nearly all practical and theoretical problems in a bottom-up, distributed manner, thus functioning like a Global Brain for humanity.},
