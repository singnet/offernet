# Introduction

Here I discuss and provide broader interpretation of results documented in the Electronic Laboratory Notebook:

1. [Experiment #1, run #1](https://singnet.github.io/offernet/public/experiment-1-run-1-corrected/)
2. [Experiment #1, run #2](https://singnet.github.io/offernet/public/experiment-1-run-2-corrected/)
3. [Experiment #1, run #3](https://singnet.github.io/offernet/public/experiment-1-run-3-corrected/)
4. [Experiment #1, run #4](https://singnet.github.io/offernet/public/experiment-1-run-4/)
5. [Experiment #1, run #5](https://singnet.github.io/offernet/public/experiment-1-run-5/)

Section [Decentralized computing in OfferNet(s)](#decentralized-computing-in-offernets) discusses the concept of open-ended decentralized computing with relationship to Offer Networks. Section [Experiment #1:comparison of decentralized and centralized search](#experiment-one) provides analysis and interpretation of data obtained from running computer simulations. All the code used by simulations and documentation (including this page) can be accessed and downloaded from [singnet/offernet](https://github.com/singnet/offernet) GitHub repository.
