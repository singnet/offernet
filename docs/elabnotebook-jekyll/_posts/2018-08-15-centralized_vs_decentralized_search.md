These are the series of experiments aimed at getting insight at similarity and cycle search routines in Offer Network and small scale testing of the framework. The general design and questions of the experiment are explained [here](https://singnet.github.io/offernet/public/offernet-documentation/implementation.html#compare-decentralized-and-centralized-search), the details of the setup -- [here](https://singnet.github.io/offernet/public/discussions/experiment-one.html). The work on this experiment is tracked on singnet/offernet GitHub repository issue [#15 Compare decentralized and centralized search of items](https://github.com/singnet/offernet/issues/15).

Current analysis of results is accessible via the link [Experiment 1: decentralized vs centralized search](https://singnet.github.io/offernet/public/discussion-corrected/) and is updated as more data comes in from simulations.
