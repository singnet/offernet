# Introduction

The goal of OfferNet experiments is to produce data in order to understand the dynamics of the system and 'computationally-prove' dynamic properties of the network. Experiments are run as tests given a list of parameters (or rather a list of lists). Each experiment consists of a number of simulations -- a concrete set of parameters. This 'e-Lab Notebook' tries to collect and document these simulations and analyse their results in a systematic way so that further experiments could be designed based on what is learned.
