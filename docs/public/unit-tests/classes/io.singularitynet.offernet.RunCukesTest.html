<pre>Feature: Agent behaviour
  
  Agents can interact with the graph structure of OfferNet by issuing semantically constrained graph traversals which query or mutate the graph as needed. These define the API of the OfferNet graph.

  @indoc
  Scenario: an agent can post an {offer-demand} pair to the OfferNet               ?[90m# AgentBehavior.feature:29?[0m
    Agents in an Offer Network engage in exchange by publishing an offer-demand pairs, or 'work's. See explanation of the Offer Network structure in [Data structures and objects].

    ?[32mGiven ?[0m?[32mAgent &quot;?[0m?[32m?[1mAgentOne?[0m?[32m&quot; is created on the OfferNet?[0m                              ?[90m# AgentBehaviorStepDefs.agentIsCreatedOnTheOfferNet(String)?[0m
    ?[32mWhen ?[0m?[32mAgent &quot;?[0m?[32m?[1mAgentOne?[0m?[32m&quot; posts a pair of offer &quot;?[0m?[32m?[1moffer-1?[0m?[32m&quot; and demand of &quot;?[0m?[32m?[1mdemand-1?[0m?[32m&quot;?[0m ?[90m# AgentBehaviorStepDefs.agent_publishes_a_pair_of_offer_and_demand_of(String,String,String)?[0m
    ?[32mThen ?[0m?[32mAgent &quot;?[0m?[32m?[1mAgentOne?[0m?[32m&quot; owns a work which &quot;?[0m?[32m?[1mdemands?[0m?[32m&quot; item &quot;?[0m?[32m?[1mdemand-1?[0m?[32m&quot;?[0m              ?[90m# AgentBehaviorStepDefs.agent_owns_a_work_which_item(String,String,String)?[0m
    ?[32mAnd ?[0m?[32mAgent &quot;?[0m?[32m?[1mAgentOne?[0m?[32m&quot; owns a work which &quot;?[0m?[32m?[1moffers?[0m?[32m&quot; item &quot;?[0m?[32m?[1moffer-1?[0m?[32m&quot;?[0m                 ?[90m# AgentBehaviorStepDefs.agent_owns_a_work_which_item(String,String,String)?[0m

  @indoc
  Scenario Outline: an agent can access all posted offers and demands by traversing its social network ?[90m# AgentBehavior.feature:38?[0m
    In a distributed system where there is no global observer which has the registry of all agents and their items of offer and demand. In this case, the only way for an agent to access items of other agents is to traverse its social network (to a given depth) and ask all friends of friends to send information about their items. Since the OfferNet is fully connected (and hopefully is a small world network) the whole network can be scanned this way, depending on availability of time and resource constrains of an agent which initiates the search. The expected number of items that an agent has to find in its social network is calculated as follows: $(numberOfAgents -1) * pairsPerAgent * 2$ (as every pair holds two items: one demand and one offer..).

    ?[36mGiven ?[0m?[36mthere exists an sequentially connected line of '&lt;numberOfAgents&gt;' agents?[0m
    ?[36mAnd ?[0m?[36mall agents have posted '&lt;pairsPerAgent&gt;' offer-demand pair each?[0m
    ?[36mWhen ?[0m?[36mfirst agent initiates search of '&lt;searchDepth&gt;' depth?[0m
    ?[36mThen ?[0m?[36magent finds '&lt;numberOfFoundItems&gt;' demands and offers in its social network?[0m

Feature: OfferNet processes
  
  The structure of OfferNet is realized as a Property Graph where agents / offers and demands connect via edges and all is enriched with properties. Agents interact with the graph (query/mutate) by executing  semantically constrained graph traversal processes. The result of these processes depend on the context of operation, but we want to make sure that they are deterministic when the context is known and clearly defined. These processes can be centralized or decentralized.
