*singnet/offernet* is the implementation of [Offer Networks](http://onet.globalbraininstitute.org) concept with Java/Groovy/Gremlin (Apache Tinkerpop 3) for the [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io/). As of now it is a standalone project aimed at researching conceptual, computational and implementational aspects of alternative decentralized economy. Results of the project will be integrated into [SingularityNET infrastructure](https://github.com/singnet), which is also under heavy development.

Apart from the code, the following documentation is available:
